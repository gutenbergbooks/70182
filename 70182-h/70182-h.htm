<p>“I am sure we can build such a flying boat,
father.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I wish I had your confidence,
Tom,” chuckled Mr. Barton Swift, the old inventor.</p>

<p>His son laughed, too. “It isn’t confidence
you lack,” he said. “It is just that you are too
cautious to seem optimistic.”</p>

<p>“Have it your own way,” rejoined his father.
“Just the same, a speed boat for the air, land,
and sea that will do all you suggest is something
to consider fearfully. Nothing to compare to it
has ever yet been launched.”</p>

<p>“But it will be launched,” cried Tom Swift
eagerly. “Somebody will put it into the air before
we know it. Why not get ahead of the
rest of the smart folks? Why not put out a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
flying boat that will make all their eyes bug
out?”</p>

<p>“Even your slang gets ahead of me, Tom,”
said his father mildly. “Just why do you wish
to strain the optic nerves of your competitors?”</p>

<p>But Tom Swift only laughed. He knew just
how young his father’s mind remained, even if
he was a semi-invalid at times and his body was
weakened by age and hard work.</p>

<p>“There is a bunch of rich men, I understand,
who mean to build a flying boat to go hunting
in up toward the Arctic Circle next summer.
There are others that believe the mystery of the
Antarctic can only be revealed through the use
of such a craft. The interior of Africa, around
Lake Tanganyika and the other great lakes can
be properly explored only by the use of some
such machine. Central South America can be
reached more easily from the Amazon and its
great branches than by any other means. Without
a flying boat, how may one fly over the falls
and escape the dangers of the rapids?”</p>

<p>“Good! Good!” exclaimed Mr. Barton Swift.
“I see you have been thinking this thing out, at
least. A great many people have excuses for
what they want to do; but you, Tom, have a reason.
What else?”</p>

<p>Tom Swift laughed again. He was a boyish
fellow, in spite of all his experiences of the past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
few years; and a boy finds it difficult at most
times to take older people into his confidence,
especially about his dreams and hopes.</p>

<p>“I do not know that my suggestion should
seem an impossibility,” Tom said, soberly. “See
what the Swift Construction Company has done
in the past. Of course, I am counting on your
help, father, to carry such a thing to a successful
conclusion.”</p>

<p>“You actually talk as though you had conceived
a plan and would put it into effect, Tom!”
cried his father.</p>

<p>“I don’t know but I have—and will,” said
Tom, smiling once more. “At any rate, I have
been revolving the scheme in my head for a long
time. I admit it. A flying boat, as the storybook
fellows write now, has ‘intrigued’ my interest.
I’m coocoo about it, to use Ned Newton’s
slang.”</p>

<p>“So you lay your knowledge of the argot to
Ned?” laughed Mr. Swift. “But this flying
boat?”</p>

<p>“A lot has been accomplished by other people.
We would not be the first in the field, by any
means. But I believe I have some ideas about
such an invention that would put us ahead of
everybody else. And that is the main thing.”</p>

<p>“The main thing, I should say, would be to
have a working hypothesis of the idea in question,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
observed Barton Swift dryly. “What
would you build a flying boat for? To what
particular use is it to be put? Therefore, in making
plans for the boat, they must fit the needs of
the craft as devised.</p>

<p>“In other words, Tom, what in the world do
you want a flying boat for? You have your air
scout, your aerial warship that you sold to the
Government during the war, your air glider
which as yet has not been equaled, your sky racer,
and your old <em>Red Cloud</em> which scarcely any
newer airship marvel has surpassed. You have
been up in the air enough, it seems to me. Why
not tackle the practical inventions of peace, as I
pointed out in your last marvel, the electric locomotive?”</p>

<p>“Give me an idea,” grumbled Tom. “What
shall I build—a new plough? Huh!”</p>

<p>“Say, Mist’ Tom! tells yo’ what,” burst into
the controversy an altogether unexpected voice.</p>

<p>The Swifts had been talking on the side piazza
of their house near the works of the Swift Construction
Company at Shopton. Just inside one
of the rear windows a grizzled old colored man
was busy preparing vegetables for dinner.</p>

<p>“I tells yo’ what!” repeated Eradicate Sampson,
the old serving man who had been with the
Swifts for years and considered himself quite one
of the family. “I tells yo’ what! Yo’ want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
invent somethin’ practical like yo’ fader says, yo’
make a machine that’ll scoop the eyes out o’ ’taters
widout wastin’ none o’ de meat. Dat wot yo’
do. Den yo’ sho’ nuff do somethin’ wuth while.”</p>

<p>Mr. Barton Swift burst into a laugh, as he
almost always did when Eradicate Sampson, or
“Rad” for short, made one of his suggestions.
Even Tom, earnest as he was about the flying
boat, grinned.</p>

<p>“I’ll take that up some day and fix it for you,
Rad,” the young fellow said.</p>

<p>“Hope yo’ does it ’fore I done git all dis bag
of ’taters used up. Dey is sho’ right eye-y. Sho’
is!”</p>

<p>“If you want to carp and criticize at ‘English
as she is spoke,’ there’s your chance, father,”
grumbled Tom. “Look after Rad. But this flying
boat idea—a craft that will sail on the water,
roll on the ground, and fly through the air——”</p>

<p>“Old stuff, Tom,” Mr. Swift answered bruskly.
“There are very good inventions of that nature
already.”</p>

<p>“Quite true,” admitted Tom, but not at all discouraged.
“But none of them so far built would
satisfy me if I were the inventor and builder.”</p>

<p>“Ah-ha!”</p>

<p>“There are faults in every one already launched.
I bet there are faults in all those now under construction,
no matter how much money there may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
be behind the invention. I am going after the
perfect flying boat, or I’ll not build any.”</p>

<p>“Well? Tell me how you will overcome the
rough-sea obstacle, for instance?” asked the very
practical Mr. Swift. “That has been puzzling
the flying boat folks ever since the beginning.
It is unsafe to descend in a heavy sea, therefore
they dare not take long voyages from land.”</p>

<p>“I mean to overcome that very thing if I tackle
the thing at all.”</p>

<p>“You speak very confidently, my son,” said
his father, looking at Tom seriously.</p>

<p>“I have thought about the invention for some
time.”</p>

<p>Mr. Barton Swift threw up his hands in mock
despair.</p>

<p>“Incurable!” he cried. “Once you get your
teeth set in a thing, Tom, there is no shaking
you loose.”</p>

<p>“I come honestly enough by that trait of character,”
said Tom, with a grin. “They say I’m
a chip off the old block.”</p>

<p>He sat up suddenly in his reclining chair and
stared toward the front of the house. Idly at
first he had heard the noise of a motor-car arriving
before the house. It had stopped there. Mr.
Swift had not appeared to notice it at all, but
Tom suddenly overheard voices.</p>

<p>“Yes, sah. Dey is at home, but dey mebbe is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
engaged on ’portant business,” said a sonorous
voice that could belong to nobody save Koku,
Tom’s giant servant whom the young inventor
had brought with him some years before from
far parts, and who had served him well and faithfully
ever since.</p>

<p>“I isn’t sure, sah. But I go see,” went on the
important sounding Koku.</p>

<p>“Listen to dat giant!” grumbled old Rad
Sampson. “Jes’ to hear him, yo’d think he was
bossin’ dis hyer fambly. Sho’ nuff! Huh!”</p>

<p>The ancient colored man and the half-civilized
Koku were sworn enemies up to a certain point.
Both professed to scorn the other’s efficiency
and abilities. And both usurped the authority of
speaking for either Tom or his father on almost
any occasion.</p>

<p>But now Koku had tried the patience of the
visitor. Overtopping the giant’s serious tones
came the sharper and more excited voice that
Tom immediately recognized. And what the
voice said startled even the placid Mr. Swift.</p>

<p>“Tom Swift! Tom Swift!” exclaimed the visitor.
“Bless my telescope, Tom Swift, but I
must see you! I must see you at once! Tom
Swift!”</p>

<p>“Ho!” cried Tom, starting up. “Ho, Koku!
Bring Mr. Damon right out here.”</p>

<p>Hearing the young inventor’s voice, Mr. Wakefield<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Damon waited for nothing more. He
rushed around the corner of the house, appearing
in an excited and a rather disheveled state upon
the side porch where the two Swifts were sitting.</p>

<p>“Bless my decrepit extremities!” exclaimed the
emphatic gentleman, thus referring to his own
feet as they stumbled over a low ottoman and
a rumpled mat. “I’m so excited I can’t even walk
straight. It’s the greatest—well, how-do, Barton
Swift? And you, Tom—how are you?”</p>

<p>Both his hosts welcomed the eccentric Wakefield
Damon warmly. He was a good friend.</p>

<p>“What good wind has brought you here,
Damon?” asked Mr. Swift, giving the visitor his
hand.</p>

<p>“No such element as wind,” declared Mr.
Damon, with his usual energy. “Air, fire and
water—the three principal elements. Nothing
like air. It’s frozen water has brought me here,
I reckon,” and he burst into a great laugh at his
own fantasy. “Ice has brought me here, not
wind.”</p>

<p>“I heard your motor-car,” said Tom smiling.
“You don’t mean to say you have invented a way
of running a car with ice for fuel?”</p>

<p>“Nothing like that! Nothing like that!” cried
Mr. Damon. “The gasoline people still rob me.
But listen! I’ve got ice in my head—and some
brains, I hope,” he added. “At any rate, I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
where to come for help when I get stuck in anything.”</p>

<p>“You bring us a problem, do you?” asked Mr.
Swift. “Well, Damon, what is it?”</p>

<p>“I have got to have Tom’s help. I want him
to take a journey with me.”</p>

<p>“A journey—just now—when I’ve so much
on my hands?” demanded the young inventor, in
considerable doubt.</p>

<p>“I’ll make it worth your while,” said Mr.
Damon quickly. “I’ve got to go to Iceland.
There’s money in it——”</p>

<p>“Money in Iceland?” interrupted Tom.</p>

<p>“So they tell me. And a lot of it is mine,”
returned the excited visitor. “I want you to go
there with me, Tom, to get a fortune. A fortune,
boy! It will pay us big.”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE TREASURE CHEST</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Since the Swifts had first known Mr. Wakefield
Damon that eccentric character had brought
to their attention a number of strange affairs, and
some of them had resulted in the betterment of
his own and the Swifts’ finances. So, no matter
how ridiculous his first proposition might sound,
Tom and his father were both ready to listen.</p>

<p>A trip to Iceland would scarcely absorb Tom
Swift’s attention just now, but the fortune Mr.
Damon promised him a share of might be a thing
not to be scorned. In spite of the inventor’s several
sources of income and the great sums already
invested in the Swift Construction Company and
in other well-paying concerns, Tom never saw the
time when he could not make good use of more
money.</p>

<p>From the time the reader was introduced to
“Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle,” the title of
the first book of this series, down to the twenty-fifth
volume, the one preceding this present story,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
“Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive,” the
young inventor has found good use for much
money.</p>

<p>His inventions—some of them marvels as his
father intimated—had brought them in much
money, it is true. But it “takes money to breed
money;” and always this is true as well as trite
in the construction and marketing of inventions.</p>

<p>“It takes the cash to put ’em over,” Ned Newton,
Tom’s dearest friend and closest co-worker,
was wont to say. “But you scheme ’em out and
I’ll find the cash.”</p>

<p>Newton, who was treasurer of the Swift Construction
Company, had faithfully done his part
whenever Tom got into a place where he needed
money. But here was Mr. Damon with the promise
of a “fortune” on which no interest would
have to be paid. The young inventor was naturally
interested, even though he might be up to
his very ears in work.</p>

<p>“That sounds awfully interesting,” he said to
the blusterous Wakefield Damon. “I don’t care
much about the ice—unless that is merely figurative—but
a fortune—well, what part of Iceland
is it in?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the visitor bluntly. “But
Iceland is not so big a country, is it? Not as big
as Australia, for instance, although it is likewise
an island.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“You can’t walk over it in a day, looking for
a fortune,” laughed Mr. Swift.</p>

<p>“Don’t expect to have to do that,” said Mr.
Damon, with an answering laugh. “But, bless
my calipers! we ought to be able to find Rosestone
on the map.”</p>

<p>“Is that the name of the place where this fortune
is—er—is it buried?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p>“Goodness only knows,” said Mr. Damon, tugging
at a big wallet and finally getting it out of
his inside pocket. “It may be hanging in the air.
But the letter comes from Rosestone. I fancy
that is a small town. And that is where the fortune
is.”</p>

<p>“A fortune in what?” asked Mr. Swift.</p>

<p>“A fortune of how much?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p>Mr. Damon blinked his eyes very rapidly.
Tom wanted to laugh, for he saw very clearly
that their questions were making their friend
think. Heretofore he had only been thrilled by
the idea of the fortune.</p>

<p>“I declare, Tom Swift! I don’t know how
much, and I do not know whether the fortune is
in money or in stocks and bonds——”</p>

<p>“Or walrus tusks,” laughed Tom. “Part of
Iceland, I understand, is a pretty savage country,
although the people may be peaceable
enough.”</p>

<p>“Then you know something about Iceland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Tom Swift? Bless my geographical dictionary!
I can’t find much about it.”</p>

<p>“It is told about in full in the encyclopedia,”
said Tom. “And it is a country that has always
interested me. But I never expect to go to
it——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, Tom Swift! Don’t say that!”
begged Mr. Damon. “I have got to have your
help.”</p>

<p>“How do you know there is enough of a fortune
to pay two people for going after it?”
laughed Tom.</p>

<p>“Here, Damon,” said Tom’s father, “you are
all excited. Sit down here and have a smoke and
tell us about it quietly.”</p>

<p>The idea of Mr. Wakefield Damon doing anything
quietly amused Tom again. But he waited
patiently for their friend to compose himself to
a degree and tell his story. Like his father, Tom
was curious.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you about Aman Dele. I met him a
good many years before I ever heard of you
Swifts. Quite by accident, too. He was a mystery
at first. It was by the strangest chance—or
so I always thought—that I came across him.
He was a man with a pocket full of money, and
he was starving to death.”</p>

<p>“Stomach trouble?” asked Mr. Swift shrewdly.</p>

<p>“The money may have been in Russian rubles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
and there wasn’t enough in his pockets to buy
an egg sandwich,” chuckled Tom.</p>

<p>“Neither of you is right,” said Wakefield
Damon, rather gravely for him. “Aman Dele
had perfectly good money—Danish money, I
found out afterward. I found him in New York
where one might think every language in the
world is spoken. But he had all the interpreters
puzzled.”</p>

<p>“And he was a Dane? Why, there is a big
Danish colony in New York.”</p>

<p>“He was of Danish extraction; but he came
from Iceland; and he came from the interior of
that island where the people live about as they
did when the island was first settled from Denmark,
or Norway, or some Scandinavian country.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Tom suddenly.
“That was away back in the time of the Norsemen.
Isn’t that right, father?”</p>

<p>“It must be,” said Mr. Swift, in agreement.</p>

<p>“And you mean that this Aman Dele spoke
Old Norse, Mr. Damon?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“And nothing else. He was just a young fellow
and very bashful. He had not entered the
country through the Emigration Bureau. He had
plenty of money, as I say, and undoubtedly had
come across on one of the big ships. Traveling
first, or possibly second cabin, his food had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
supplied him at the table d’hôte. He had not
been obliged to talk. And he did not know a word
of French or English, or modern Danish.”</p>

<p>“I declare!” exclaimed Mr. Swift. “But
money speaks with a louder tongue than anything
else! He had money. But it was probably
modern Icelandic he spoke, Tom,” he added.</p>

<p>“He was both bashful and afraid,” said Mr.
Damon in answer to Mr. Swift, eagerly reciting
his story. “He had tried to talk to people until
he was ashamed. And he dared not show his
money for fear somebody would get it away
from him. He was, as I found out afterward,
walking about New York hoping to see some
sign familiar to him, or to hear a word of his
mother tongue spoken on the street, and growing
more and more frightened.”</p>

<p>“Fat chance of hearing any Icelandic!” murmured
the interested Tom Swift.</p>

<p>“I should say so! I should say so!” agreed
Mr. Damon. “And so I thought after I found
out what was the matter with the fellow. I saw
him lurking in the mouth of an alley right beside
a sausage shop. It was over on the lower East
Side, and I had just come up from the docks
where I had bidden good-bye to some friends
who were going to Central America. Almost all
the Spigotti boats sailed from the East River
docks in those days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“Well, sir, I saw this young, pale, well-dressed
fellow lounging there, and just the look of him
interested me. He looked so clean and foreign
in his dress, and so out of place. As I watched
him, the sausage man came to the door and flung
a piece of sausage to a stray dog. The dog
grabbed it and ran into the alley. The next moment—bless
my links of frankfurters!—this
strange fellow grabbed the sausage from the dog
and commenced eating it while the disappointed
dog ran off howling.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of anything so ridiculous?
I was stricken stock-still with amazement, myself.
Bless my boots! I was stuck right there,
staring at the young fellow gnawing on that half
spoiled sausage.”</p>

<p>“The poor fellow,” murmured Mr. Swift.</p>

<p>“That’s right. It aroused more than my curiosity.
I saw that although he was well dressed
and all that, he was starving. I walked right
across the street and into the alley and grabbed
him,” said Mr. Damon.</p>

<p>“He was scared and tried to break away, and
even offered me the sausage,” continued the narrator.
“Guess he thought I was some sort of a
policeman. But I was strong in those days and
I hung onto him. There was a little coffee shop
in sight and I made him go with me there. Just
the smell of that rank coffee almost made him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
faint. But I made him sip it slowly, and afterward
he put away a beefsteak and bread and butter
and more coffee. Then his face began to
light up as though there was an electric bulb
turned on inside of his skull.”</p>

<p>“Interesting—vastly interesting,” commented
Mr. Swift. “But this fortune?”</p>

<p>“I’m coming to it. Give me time,” said Mr.
Damon. Then, grinning, he added: “Bless my
pocketbook! you can’t expect to get a fortune
in a minute.”</p>

<p>“But we hope to hear about the treasure chest
pretty soon,” put in Tom.</p>

<p>Mr. Damon selected a paper from several he
took from his wallet. He unfolded it and spread
it out so that both the Swifts could read what
was written on it. It seemed to be the final paragraphs
of a personal letter to Mr. Damon, and
Tom read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“* * * So, my dear Mr. Damon, it was always
on our friend’s mind that you should see his
country. He had seen the world and he believed
nothing in it was so beautiful and good as Iceland.
And Rosestone is the beauty spot of that
beautiful island. You know he has written you
again and again to come here. ‘Ah!’ he said
to me, his other friend, ‘I will bring him at last.
Those Americans are all for business—for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
making of money. It costs a great deal to live
in America, and my friend, Damon, may need
more than he has now before he dies.’</p>

<p>“So, Mr. Damon, he arranged it this way:
His will was made and is proved in our courts.
His chest of treasure is waiting for you. But
you must come in person and get it. You are to
visit his grave before you can have possession of
the fortune Aman Dele intended you to have. It
is my duty to see that his intentions are fulfilled.</p>

<p>“I hope to see you within the year. I would
like to get this responsibility off my mind, for
I am an old man and my time may be near. Start
at once for Iceland, and let me know when you
expect to reach Rosestone.</p>

<span class="fs80">AMAN DELE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Now, bless my inmost thoughts! what do
you think of that?” Mr. Damon demanded, and
burst into another great laugh. “Isn’t it a fact
that the very strangest things happen to me? I
never imagined that day when I fed that starving
Icelander that he was rich and would die and
leave me a fortune. We were both young men
then.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Mr. Swift, warmly, “this is wonderful,
Damon! It surely is an instance of casting
your bread on the waters and getting it back
after many days.”</p>

<p>“With interest!” chuckled the visitor. “For
all I did was to feed Aman Dele and help him
find himself——”</p>

<p>“With your usual kindness,” broke in Tom,
likewise with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” exclaimed Wakefield Damon, with
a gesture of dismissal. “Let me tell you more
about that Dele. We sat there in the coffee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
house and stared at each other and neither of us
knew how to make the other understand what he
wanted to say. But finally I got it in my head
that the first thing was to find out where the fellow
came from—what part of the world, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Quite true,” murmured Mr. Swift. “That
was bright of you.”</p>

<p>“Bless my brain-pan! I should say so,” cried
Mr. Damon, with another laugh. “I grabbed him
again and led him to the nearest library. He was
more scared than ever, if possible. But I got out
a big book of maps and we sat down to look
them over. This at last made him know I was
a friend.</p>

<p>“Dele couldn’t read the names of the countries
we looked at; but I knew by his shining eyes
that he recognized the shape of some of them.
He knew the British Isles. Then we turned the
leaves to Sweden and Norway and he began to
jabber that strange tongue of his. Then we hit
little Denmark, and I was sure we were getting
warm,” and once more Mr. Damon broke into
laughter.</p>

<p>“But we had turned the pages so fast at first
that we skipped Greenland and Iceland and Dele
kept shaking his head at every country I showed
him. But I was sure it must have a close connection
with Denmark, wherever his country lay.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
So we went back to the beginning and all of a
sudden he let out a howl.</p>

<p>“Bless my outlines! he acted tickled to death
to see the map of Iceland. Until that time I had
had an idea it was as deserted a place as Upper
Greenland,” went on Mr. Damon. “Well, bless
my pocket atlas! I had spotted the land he had
come from I was sure. So I went to the librarian
and told him the fix I was in and he actually
guessed that Dele was one of those folk who
talked like the old Norsemen—like Eric the Red,
and Leif Ericksen, and those other Norsemen
who swept the seas clean in the old days.</p>

<p>“So we found a couple of books with passages
printed in them in Old Norse. When Dele saw
them he was tickled pink. He read them as
though they were the last edition of the sporting
extra!” and Mr. Damon began to laugh once
more.</p>

<p>“Bless my antiques! but it seemed to me he
was as far behind the times as the rudder of
Noah’s ark.”</p>

<p>“What did you do with him?” asked Mr. Barton
Swift, much amused.</p>

<p>“Well, you know, I couldn’t turn him adrift.
Besides, by that time we had learned to understand
each other a little by signs. I borrowed
the books and we took them to my rooms. In
a few days I had learned half a dozen Icelandic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
words (I’ve forgotten ’em all now) and Aman
Dele had learned how to order ham and eggs
and a cup of coffee in restaurant English,” and
Damon went off into another loud burst of
laughter.</p>

<p>“So we got on pretty well. And by and by
he showed me the money he carried. And then,
bless my pocketbook, I <em>was</em> bowled over! I,
thinking he was as poor as a church mouse all
the time! Bless my exchange! When we got
that Danish money turned into American coin of
the realm, it seemed he had thousands of dollars.”</p>

<p>“That <em>was</em> an experience,” commented Tom’s
father.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. He stayed with me until he
learned to know the ropes and could speak fair
English. He traveled all over the country and
came back to visit me again. He was urgent that
I should go to Iceland with him. Said there
was no part of America as fine as the place he
lived. He objected to the States because we
didn’t have reindeer pulling our street cars instead
of horses. This was before the age of the
trolley, you know.</p>

<p>“Bless my antlers! wouldn’t that have looked
fine? Cars dragged by reindeer! Well, I could
not go home with him, and all through these years
he has written me, off and on, to try to get me
to take the journey to his little home town. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
he’s left me this fortune. But, you see, he’s fixed
it so that I must finally visit his home if I am
to enjoy his legacy.”</p>

<p>“That is awfully interesting, Mr. Damon.
But why don’t you go right along and get the
treasure chest alone?” Tom asked.</p>

<p>“Bless my brassbound luggage!” cried Mr.
Damon. “Go alone to Iceland? I don’t believe
I could ever find it!”</p>

<p>The Swifts laughed at that joke; but Tom continued
to shake his head. And it was a most
decided shake, at that.</p>

<p>“Iceland is perfectly civilized. The only danger
you run is being cheated by hotel keepers and
travelers’ agents.”</p>

<p>“But, Tom, the treasure!”</p>

<p>“You don’t even know how much it is,”
chuckled the young inventor. “Perhaps it isn’t
large enough to divide in half even! It maybe
won’t pay you for going alone, let alone paying
me. And I’m a sight too busy to go so far away
from Shopton right now.”</p>

<p>“I’ll guarantee you that the treasure is a big
one. How much will you want to leave what
you are doing and go with me?” demanded their
strange friend, with much earnestness.</p>

<p>“I tell you it can’t be done!” and Tom continued
to wag his head negatively.</p>

<p>“You’ve got something so important that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
cannot possibly go with me?” It was plain that
Mr. Wakefield Damon was going to be vastly
disappointed.</p>

<p>“Perhaps. Father and I were just talking over
a scheme that greatly interests me, I admit. But
there is another thing that stays me at this time.
Mr. Nestor—perhaps you have heard it?—is
very ill. I would not want to go away now.
You know, Mary Nestor would feel—rightly so,
I think—that I was neglecting her if I left for
Iceland at this time.”</p>

<p>“Bless my doctor’s book!” growled the disappointed
Mr. Damon. “What is the matter with
all the doctors nowadays? Don’t any of them
know enough to help Mary’s father? I was over
to see him myself last week. Looks to me as
though the medicos were just experimenting
with him. I’m thankful to say I seldom have
any need for medicine or doctors.”</p>

<p>“I fancy the physicians are puzzled about Mr.
Nestor’s case,” said Mr. Barton Swift thoughtfully.
“But they have sent for a specialist to
come up from New York. We may learn shortly
more about what is the matter with him. This
New York doctor has had wonderful success.
They say the cures he has to his credit are almost
miraculous.”</p>

<p>Mr. Damon looked rather gloomy. But he expressed
sympathy for Mary’s father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“He’s a fine man. I wish him well. But I’m
mighty sorry if his sickness stands in the way of
your going with me, Tom,” he grumbled.</p>

<p>“Oh, I might find other reasons, too,” declared
Tom, smiling.</p>

<p>“Bless my pocketbook, Tom! name your own
price,” cried his eccentric friend.</p>

<p>“It can’t be done, I tell you. You go on to
Iceland. When you get back I may have something
to show you that you will agree was quite
worth my while.”</p>

<p>Even to Mr. Damon the young inventor was
not ready to talk about his plans for the flying
boat that so engrossed his mind. The visitor remained
to dinner; but Tom did not once mention
this particular topic which he had been discussing
with his father previous to Mr. Damon’s appearance.</p>

<p>The latter, seeing he could not have his way
with his young friend in the matter of the voyage
to Iceland, did not sulk. As usual he cheerfully—and
noisily—discussed plans for the voyage,
blessing almost everything and everybody
that might be connected with the proposed journey.</p>

<p>“I shall start next week, go to Denmark, and
from there take ship to Iceland. I’ve found out
already that is the way to do. But I hate traveling
alone, as you both know. And I shall want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
to get back again as soon as possible, for I am
curious about this new thing you are studying
about, Tom. Will it be a land, water, or air marvel?”</p>

<p>But Tom refused to be drawn into any discussion
at all about his idea. “Wait!” was all he
would say to his old friend.</p>

</div>

<p>Tom Swift, as has been said, did not overlook
the value of money and the good uses to which
it might be put. But he did not think that he
wanted any share in Mr. Wakefield Damon’s
venture after the mysterious treasure chest that
had been left to him in the interior areas of Iceland.
He was telling Mary Nestor about it that
evening as he was driving her in his electric runabout
through the suburbs of Shopton and out
into the country.</p>

<p>If Tom did not go after her and actually insist
upon the girl’s taking a frequent ride with him,
Mary would scarcely have had “a sniff of the
open air,” as her mother told her. They were
both much engaged in caring for Mr. Nestor,
whose disease at this time evaded the diagnoses
of all the physicians who had attended him.</p>

<p>With Mary, as well as with his father and
Ned Newton, Tom usually discussed the most
secret plans regarding his inventions; so, besides
telling Mary about Mr. Damon’s odd predicament,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
he likewise spoke of his hope of building
a better flying boat than had as yet been perfected.
Some of his ideas upon this subject were not new
to the girl.</p>

<p>“I believe you will achieve a really wonderful
thing, Tom,” she told him, with enthusiasm.
“But it will be a monster—bigger than your great
airship that you sold the Government.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure about those details as yet,”
Tom said, shaking his head and looking sharply
ahead, for the dusk was gathering fast. “The
idea is just milling in my mind. Yet, I confess,
I have had Ned Newton do a little figuring for
me—especially regarding the getting of estimates
for certain parts. Our shops cannot turn out
every part of such a craft any more than we could
build all of the electric locomotive we sold to
the Hendrickton and Pas Alos Railroad.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid, Tom,” Mary asked doubtfully,
“to trust outside people with your plans
that way? Somebody in some other shop may
steal your ideas.”</p>

<p>He shook his head, smiling. “No, no. I never
trust my plans in full to any of the construction-works
people. I may have my wings built in one
shop, the cabin-boat in another, or the prow in a
third. And, of course, we shall buy the motors
outright. No, no. An invention is like a doctor’s
prescription. When it is put together it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
takes a pretty good analyst to discover the ingredients.
And the parts of an invention have to
be assembled by the mind that dreamed out the
whole contraption.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” sighed Mary, “I wish some doctor
had a prescription that would help father.”</p>

<p>“I wish so, too!” cried Tom heartily. “When
does the specialist arrive?”</p>

<p>“Dr. Raddiker?”</p>

<p>“Is that his name?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Some kind of a foreigner. A very
learned man, I believe,” Mary said, with rising
confidence. “What Dr. Goslap tells mother and
me about him encourages us vastly. Dr. Raddiker
is a great diagnostician.”</p>

<p>“Wonder what sort of a doctor this fellow
needs who is coming along the road?” demanded
Tom suddenly. “He’ll have that car climbing
the telephone poles next.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, Tom!” cried Mary, likewise seeing
the eccentrically acting car ahead of them, and
evidently heading for Shopton. “He’ll have it in
the ditch next.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” shouted Tom. “That’s exactly
where he has got it!”</p>

<p>At that moment the car ahead backed around
into the hedge on one side of the highway and
then shot across the road and plunged, nose-first,
into the deep ditch on the other side, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
here undefended by a railing. Tom and Mary
heard a wild shout for “Hellup!” and then an
explosion of phrases that the young inventor was
glad were uttered in some foreign tongue, for he
feared that they were not polite enough for
Mary’s ear.</p>

<p>Tom Swift speeded up his runabout and they
reached the scene of the accident just as the awkward
chauffeur was crawling out of the mud.
The nose of the car was buried in the mire and the
occupant of the tonneau of the car was struggling
with the door while he ejaculated in broken
English:</p>

<p>“Hellup! Why for did I let such a dumbskull
drive de car? Ach! I should be shot for my
foolishness, undt he should be hung for inefficiency.
Yah! Hellup!”</p>

<p>Mary hopped out of Tom’s car quickly and
ran to help the excited stranger open the door
of the closed car. But Tom turned his attention
to the chauffeur. Nothing could be done for the
car itself, he saw at a glance, on its own power.</p>

<p>“Hi!” Tom shouted to the fellow in the ditch.
“Go back and shut off your engine. She is heading
for China right now. Want her to go there?”</p>

<p>“She can go to perdition for all of me!” grumbled
the mud-covered chauffeur. “She’s got the
Old Boy in her.”</p>

<p>“For vy you call it me names?” demanded the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
passenger, indignantly, just then bursting out of
the motor-car. He was a bushy-headed man
with owl-like spectacles and evidently the possessor
of a querulous temper. “He is most insulting!
Undt he is the worst driver I ever had.
Dumbskull!”</p>

<p>“You’re the Old Boy, all right, but not the one
I meant was in that engine,” growled the chauffeur
sullenly. “You are a crazy nuisance——”</p>

<p>Tom had got out, reached the head of the car,
and by leaning down the ditch side with care,
he shut off the thumping engine. He now swung
to look at the muttering chauffeur. The latter
was ill-favored of feature and betrayed frankly
that his mental condition had been brought about
by indulgence in liquor.</p>

<p>“You work for Peltin Brothers, at Norwalk,”
Tom said sharply. “I’ve seen you before. This
car from their garage?”</p>

<p>“He comes from it, the Norwalk garage,” interposed
the strange man who was now rescuing
sundry bundles and bags from the interior of the
car. “The car, it is mine. My other driver leaf
me in one lurch, you say, no? This fellow—ah-ha!
He is a low-life. It is not gasoline he
buy for the car, but bad whisky for himself.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are in a bad mess,” Tom said to
the driver. “Come on and let’s see what we can
do about getting her up on the road.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>The man shook his head vigorously. He
backed away, up the side of the ditch. When
he reached the sound road he started right away
from there, only looking back over his shoulder
to bawl:</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t help that crazy guy, or touch that
car, for a farm down east with a pig on’t. You
can have it, for all o’ me!”</p>

<p>“Well!” exclaimed Mary, in disgust.</p>

<p>“A fine dog that!” grumbled Tom ruefully.</p>

<p>“A dumbskull!” ejaculated the strange gentleman,
standing amid his baggage.</p>

<p>“Why! How mean!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“Where were you going, sir?” Tom Swift
asked.</p>

<p>“To a place called Shopton. Do you know it?”</p>

<p>“We live there,” said the young inventor
briskly. “It is not far. If nobody else comes
along, the young lady will drive you in my runabout.
I will stay until help comes for the car.
Or, maybe, we can get it out of the mud ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Ach! Not me!” cried the stranger. “I must
not soil or injure my hands. I do not lift weights.
I am not here to strain my muscles and rack my
nerves for such things as this. Ach, no!”</p>

<p>Tom and Mary stared at each other. They did
not know whether to be amused or disgusted with
the stranger. He seemed willing enough to accept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
help, but he was not inclined to help himself!</p>

<p>“Well,” Tom said finally, and dryly, “you don’t
mind if I try to recover your car for you?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” declared the man, with a shrug.
“You will do what you please. But I, I do not
aid.”</p>

<p>“But it is your car? You bought and paid for
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! What has that to do with it? I
know my place. It is not working in the muddy
ditch over a motor-car. No!”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” muttered Tom to Mary. “His
place is somewhere on a mantelpiece for an ornament.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Tom,” the girl said. “Will you help
him?”</p>

<p>“For my own satisfaction, not because I am
inclined to play the Samaritan to such a fellow.
I’ll lend the helping hand.”</p>

<span class="fs80">WHAT CAME OF IT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Queerly as this man acted, Tom Swift could
not have left either him or his car on the road
and in the lurch. He would have felt himself
to be as mean as the half intoxicated chauffeur
from the Norwalk garage.</p>

<p>Besides, the young fellow knew without her
telling him that Mary would expect him to do
all he could in the emergency, and Mary’s opinion
was, of course, of the first importance to
Tom. While the stranger sat on the bank of
the ditch with his baggage about him, not offering
to lift his hand to aid, the young inventor
planned and put into execution a method of rescuing
the mired automobile.</p>

<p>He had a small ax in the tool box of the electric
runabout. With this he cut a green, tough
sapling about as big around as his shank. This
he used to pry the nose of the stranger’s motor-car
out of the mud.</p>

<p>He used the pry to break down the edge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
ditch, too, and finally he used a couple of nonskid
chains to tackle the two cars together, and
with the power of his own machine, used very
skilfully, he finally dragged the other car to the
highway.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the owner of that car sat placidly,
smoking little, strong-smelling cigarettes which
he rolled himself with dextrous fingers, and
watched the work quite impersonally. Mary disapproved
of cigarettes in any case and she whispered
to Tom that she didn’t know but she was
sorry that she had urged him to help the strange
man!</p>

<p>“Ach! Brawn is not to be scorned,” said the
man, when the motor-car stood upon its four
wheels on the road. “It is not so good like
brains—no, no. But if one has not the brains
and the learning, it is well to be a mechanic,
yes?”</p>

<p>Mary grew rosy-red at that. She considered
it an insult to Tom Swift. She might have said
something sharp, but her friend interposed, with
a grin:</p>

<p>“They say that a man with brains alone on a
desert island will live where a dull man, possessing
only strength, would die. But I bet a stupid
man with good muscles will live better in the
haunts of civilization than a penniless man of
brains. What would you do if you had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
marooned here without money and nobody to
help you?”</p>

<p>“Ach! You are, perhaps, a philosopher?”
grumbled the man.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to possess much book education
to be that,” laughed Tom. “Well, sir, you
get in the runabout with the young lady. She
can drive. I’ll try to bring your car along behind.
Where are you stopping in Shopton?” he added,
as the man began to gather his various bags and
bundles and pack them into the runabout until
there was scarcely room for the girl to reach the
pedals with her feet.</p>

<p>“Is there not a hotel, no?”</p>

<p>“The Shopton House. A commercial hotel.”</p>

<p>“I will try it. This is one vacation. I have
but one thing to do while I am avay from New
York. I need the change and fresh air, or I
vould never come to a place like this in answer
to any call. No!”</p>

<p>“I wonder what and who he is,” thought Tom
Swift, as Mary finally started the runabout and
he, himself, climbed into the other car.</p>

<p>The car had been pretty well shaken up by its
plunge into the ditch; and the engine balked several
times before Tom managed to get it to town.
Therefore Mary got far ahead of him with the
car’s owner.</p>

<p>When Tom Swift got to the Shopton House<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
he found his electric runabout standing at the
curb. Mary had gone home, for it was now quite
late in the evening. Tom ran the shaken car to
the nearest garage and then went into the hotel
to leave word for the stranger where his property
could be found.</p>

<p>“You just had a guest come in, didn’t you?”
Tom asked the clerk.</p>

<p>The latter began to grin. “You mean the foreign
feller?”</p>

<p>“Some kind of a Dutchman, I guess,” said the
young inventor. “What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“Look on the book and see,” was the reply.
“I can’t read it, and I don’t know what to call
him. He not only speaks broken English, but
he writes broken English.”</p>

<p>“Really?” responded Tom, with a laugh.
“Let’s take a squint at it.”</p>

<p>He wheeled the register about on its swivel
and peered at the crabbed writing. He could
read “NewYork,U.S.of Amerika.” But the
name of the man looked as much like a hen track
as it did like anything written in the English
language.</p>

<p>“He’s one of these foreign musicians, I bet,”
said the clerk to Tom. “And he wanted a room
with a bath and hot running water!”</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything like that in this house,”
answered Tom, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“If there was, I’d rent it myself,” declared the
other. “He sniffed a lot about ‘de pad accommodations’;
but he’s staying the night. Want
to see him?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ve seen enough of him, to tell the
truth,” said Tom. “But you’d better get word
to him where his car is. And don’t tell him anything
about me! I don’t want him hunting me
up and either thanking me or trying to pay me.”</p>

<p>But secretly Tom did not believe the queer
stranger would ever consider it necessary to thank
those who had helped him out of his difficulty.</p>

<p>“He’s one more Dutchman with a swelled
head,” was the young inventor’s private comment,
as he drove his runabout home.</p>

<p>It was too late to go to Mary’s house again.
But in the morning, the first thing when he
reached his private office, he called the Nestor
house. Mrs. Nestor answered the call and Tom
knew, by her voice, that she was much disturbed.</p>

<p>“The doctors were here for a consultation
again early this morning, Tom,” the woman said
brokenly. “They seem to have very little hope
that Mr. Nestor will ever be better. And they
have given up hope of the specialist’s coming——”</p>

<p>“You mean the Dr. Raddiker Mary was
speaking of?” asked Tom quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes. They expected him yesterday. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
find he has left New York for a vacation and,
being such a busy man, he probably will not come
here to consult with our doctors on a single case.
They give us no hope——”</p>

<p>“Oh! Don’t say that, Mrs. Nestor!” Tom interrupted.</p>

<p>“It is the way we both feel,” said Mary’s
mother. “If I knew of any diagnostician or specialist
whom we could secure, no matter what
it costs, I would ask you to get him here, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Wait!” cried Tom suddenly. “I’m coming
over. There must be some way——”</p>

<p>He hung up without finishing his sentence. To
tell the truth he had no idea how to help Mrs.
Nestor and Mary. But it seemed to him that it
was almost brutal just to remain idle while the
sick man slowly lost strength and vitality.</p>

<p>He had intended giving his entire attention that
day to considering plans for the flying boat that
he was determined to build. But his fears for
Mr. Nestor and his sympathy for Mary and her
mother would not allow of that.</p>

<p>He pulled down the roller-top of his desk again
and started out of the shops. He had no idea
what he could do to help; and yet milling about
in his brain there was a hazy idea that there <em>must</em>
be something which could be done to aid Mary’s
father.</p>

<p>If that Dr. Raddiker had only come to consult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
upon the case! Mary had spoken of him
so hopefully. Dr. Raddiker. Another of these
crazy foreigners, perhaps—-</p>

<p>The thought of the unreadable writing on the
Shopton House register the evening before suddenly
stabbed Tom Swift’s brain like a ray of
light in the darkness. He said afterward that
his mind seemed to be suddenly lit up by a startling
thought.</p>

<p>He started on a run for downtown, not even
waiting to get out the car.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="fs80">THE PRONOUNCEMENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The clerk of the Shopton House with whom
Tom had talked the previous evening was standing
in the doorway, grinning widely. He hailed
the younger fellow before the latter could put his
first question:</p>

<p>“Hey, there, Swift! Looking for the Great
Unknown?”</p>

<p>“That foreigner? Yes. Is he here?” demanded
Tom.</p>

<p>“Just gone. Couldn’t stand us any longer. We
don’t know how to make coffee as they make it
in some place he called Vienna. There’s no
Vienna in this state.”</p>

<p>“He means Vienna, Austria. Did he start for
that place before breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe. Anyway, he got the boy to cart
all his truck over to the garage. He is going to
leave town at once.”</p>

<p>“Not much he won’t, if he’s the man I think
he is!” exclaimed Tom, under his breath, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
started for the garage. “I ought to have guessed
it last night.”</p>

<p>The motor-car Tom had rescued on the road
had been repaired and was now standing by the
curb. Its owner had hired another driver to take
him on his way. Big spectacles and all, the
stranger was planted in the back seat with his
goods and chattels around him. He welcomed
Tom Swift with a sort of sour smile.</p>

<p>“They tell me you are an inventor and a young
man of property, yes—no?” began the peculiar
man. “So it would be to insult you to offer you
pay for what you did for me last evening.
Yes?”</p>

<p>“You can insult me by offering money, all
right,” answered Tom. “But I mean to exact
payment for helping you.”</p>

<p>“Ach! Yes? Indeed? And how shall I pay
you?”</p>

<p>“You are Dr. Raddiker!” exclaimed the young
fellow.</p>

<p>“For sure. Dr. Simon Raddiker. Undt I
mean to get away from this place soon. What is
your bill?”</p>

<p>“You came up here to consult with some doctors
upon a case that is puzzling them, did you
not?”</p>

<p>“Not at all! Not at all!” cried the other. “I
am on one vacation. I am in no mood to consult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
mit dese country doctors. Ach! For why should
I work when it is a vacation I need?”</p>

<p>“But think of the sick man!” cried Tom almost
angrily. “Suppose he needs you?”</p>

<p>“I do not know that. I know nothing about it
yet. Why should I consider him?” and the
scientist shrugged his shoulders. “What is he
to me?”</p>

<p>“He’s a good deal to me,” declared Tom Swift
sternly. “You must pay me for helping you out
last night by seeing this man—Mr. Nestor.”</p>

<p>“Not so! Not so!” cried Dr. Raddiker, his
eyes flashing behind his huge spectacles. “Ach!
You are like one of these American bandits—yes?
You say you will take what you want if
I will not give it cheerfully, yes? Ach!”</p>

<p>“That is the only way you can pay your bill,”
declared Tom.</p>

<p>“Then the bill, it goes unpaid,” Raddiker almost
snarled at him. To the driver of the car
he added: “Go on! I haf enough of this town.
I never want to see it again.”</p>

<p>The querulous, nervous, excited savant was
doubtless an unhappy soul, and he liked to make
other people unhappy. He turned about as the
car started and cried:</p>

<p>“Gif my regards to the young lady. She was
very nice and friendly yet. She is the only nice
person I meet since I come from New York.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“Hold on!” commanded Tom. He leaped upon
the running board and leaned over and stopped
the car in spite of the chauffeur. His eyes
flashed into those of the remarkable Dr. Raddiker.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” he repeated. “You speak of that
girl. Do you know who she is? It is her father
who is dying and whom the doctors here want
you to visit. Can’t you do that much for the
poor girl who was nice to you?”</p>

<p>“You are telling me the truth—yes?” stammered
Raddiker doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Tell this man to drive you to Mr. Nestor’s
house. His daughter will be there,” the young
fellow replied.</p>

<p>“Vell! Vell!” agreed Raddiker. “Go on. We
will try. But if you deceive me—Ach!”</p>

<p>He was evidently very angry. Tom did not
care how angry the man was with him; he was
determined he should fulfill his agreement with
the local doctors and examine Mr. Nestor.</p>

<p>Tom rode beside the chauffeur and the moment
the car stopped at the Nestor place he called Mary
to the door and ran in himself and had Mrs.
Nestor call up the two doctors who had been
attending her husband.</p>

<p>Dr. Raddiker put the best face he could on a
troublesome matter, now that he saw Mary and
knew that the patient was one in whom she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
an interest. Mary had quite charmed the grouchy
savant. He stamped into the house with one of
his small bags, peering about through his huge
spectacles, and apparently criticising unfavorably
everything that he saw.</p>

<p>It was certain that he criticised everything the
doctors in the case had done and bluntly told
them his small opinion of them when they arrived
in haste to meet him. But they knew Raddiker
and his unpleasant manners and accepted
his diatribes in silence. One of the local physicians
afterward told Tom that he considered a
man with as keen a mind as the foreign doctor
had the right to be as ungentlemanly as he
pleased.</p>

<p>“Not a bit!” cried the young inventor. “The
greatest man in the world could not be excused
for using such language or displaying such a
mean spirit.”</p>

<p>However, in the matter of Mr. Nestor’s illness,
the famous Dr. Raddiker did his work well,
being pressed to it by the circumstances. Had
it not been for Tom Swift he would have gone
away disgruntled from Shopton and refused to
see the invalid.</p>

<p>But, as was the nature of the strange man,
having once questioned the other physicians and
gained a full history of the case, he became interested.
And once he was interested in a puzzling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
problem, Dr. Raddiker hung on to it like a bulldog
to a bone!</p>

<p>He would not allow them to remove his automobile
from before the door, and it remained in
readiness for departure. He was in just as much
haste as ever to leave the despised Shopton. But
he stayed beside Mr. Nestor’s bed for twelve
hours, watching him, studying the fluctuating
symptoms of the disease, and finally late that
night was ready to give his diagnosis.</p>

<p>Having scolded the other doctors and having
declared that no medicine could aid the patient,
Dr. Raddiker left to continue his “vacation” after
making a most strange pronouncement regarding
the case. When Tom Swift heard of it the next
day he was inclined to believe that the savant
was quite as mad as he appeared to be.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” he cried. “You don’t mean
he said <em>that</em>, Mary? That your father must go
to the Arctic? The man is mad! Maybe he expects
him to join some party in search of the
Pole? Don’t tell me that fellow is a scientist!
He has escaped from a madhouse!”</p>

<p>But the physician had been serious. A change
of climate was all that would save Mr. Nestor.
And a change to a very cold climate was the
change that would be most efficacious.</p>

<p>The local doctors were quite serious about it.
The disease from which Mr. Nestor suffered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
when once named by Raddiker, was recognized
as a rare but well understood trouble. A few
weeks in a climate of keen frost might entirely
eradicate the germs of the disease that had
stricken Mary’s father.</p>

<p>The treatment had been pointed out. To say
“change of climate” was all very well. But as
Mary confessed to Tom, the way for such a
change seemed closed. Who was to go with Mr.
Nestor on any such journey?</p>

<p>He could not go alone. Mrs. Nestor was in
such health herself that the physicians would not
recommend such a journey for her. In fact, they
forbade thought of it. Mary could not leave her
mother.</p>

<p>“Besides, father could not be burdened with a
girl,” she confessed to Tom Swift. “He should
have no responsibilities upon his mind but the
recovery of his own health. That Raddiker!
He told us just enough to stir us all up and add
to our worriments. He told us how father might
be aided to health, but he does not point out the
way for us to bring it about. I declare, Tom,
neither mother nor I has the first idea of what
we ought to do!”</p>

<span class="fs80">A GOOD DEAL ON HIS MIND</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Tom came around by the slaughter house at
the railroad switch, on the far edge of Shopton,
on his way home from the Nestor house. He
knew several of the men who worked there, and
he wanted something that could only be supplied
in the vicinity of the town at that place.</p>

<p>“Pigs’ bladders? The land sake! What for,
Mister Tom?” demanded Harry M’Connel, the
man the young inventor asked. “You ain’t makin’
no contraption for to make pigs fly, are you,
now? The price of pork has gone up high enough
already.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure that the bladders may not
help me scheme out something that will aid man
to fly,” laughed Tom Swift.</p>

<p>“You shall have the bladders,” declared M’Connel.
“But I never mean to go up in one of them
flying machines myself. Still and all, there’s
some folks I’d just as lief would go scootin’ skyward
as not, and I hope if they do they never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
come down again,” added the slaughter-house
man, grumblingly.</p>

<p>He went outside, selected a pair of good-sized
pigs’ bladders, washed them, and brought them
back to the young inventor. Tom thanked him
and went home with the bladders. When a little
boy he used to get these bladders for balloons.
He blew them up now in the same way, tied them,
and hung them out of his bedroom window to
dry, warning Rad and Koku to let them alone.</p>

<p>“Master make great medicine with them,” the
giant declared to Rad Sampson. “Make wonder!
Whoo!”</p>

<p>“Yo’ make me sick—whoo!” muttered old Rad.
“What kind of med’cine you think can be made
out o’ a pig’s bladder, big man? You is sho’-nuff
crazy.”</p>

<p>But Koku remembered what the magicians and
medicine men did with such receptacles in his own
country and shook his head. He held Tom Swift
quite as able to make black magic as any medicine
man who ran half naked in the wilds.</p>

<p>“You see!” he declared earnestly. “Master
make big noise. Do wunnerful thing. Mighty
smart.”</p>

<p>“Which <em>you</em> isn’t,” declared Eradicate with
scorn. “I dunno what Mist’ Swift and Mars’
Tom wants yo’ round yere for, anyway. Yo’
ain’t a smitch o’ good, as I can see. Yo’ ain’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
even to be trusted to peel spuds. I haf to peel
de peels after you.”</p>

<p>“Koku great chief. He cannot do woman’s
work.”</p>

<p>“Hey!” cried old Rad. “Since you got dat
checkered suit out West dere, whar Mars’ Tom
took his electric engine, dere ain’t been any holdin’
yo’. Makes yo’ too uppity to wear good clo’es.
A breech-clout an’ a string of beads is de best
yo’ knowed about dressin’ ’fore yo’ come here.”</p>

<p>Koku showed his teeth at that, and stalked
away. He liked to exercise authority about the
house and the shops; but Rad had been here
long before Koku, and he would not endure
any usurpation in the control of even small
things.</p>

<p>When there was no subject of controversy between
them, however, the two were very good
friends. The giant often shouldered burdens for
Rad and said nothing about it. And he never
took one of his wild jaunts through the countryside
about Shopton that he did not bring back to
Rad some treasure, or present—often of a laughter-provoking
nature.</p>

<p>Both Rad and Koku loved to go fishing at Lake
Carlopa, and two mornings later they stole away
after breakfast with tackle and bait for the near
shore of the lake. They went to a favorite strip
of low bank, hidden by hazel brush from observation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
except from the open lake, and cast for
white perch which were known to be plentiful at
this spot.</p>

<p>At first the perch were shy and Koku began
to mutter charms to entice them.</p>

<p>“Hey! Yo’ call dat Voodoo talk?” grumbled
Rad, who was religious himself and did not approve
of “no heathen jabber.” “Yo’ stop dat,
Koku! De good Lawd’ll send some kind of a
big fish—a eel, mebbe—an’ tangle you all up an’
swaller yo’ alibe. Huh! I got a bite. See dere,
big man. I’s got it! Not you, you ole——-Woof!”</p>

<p>For what he jerked ashore when he thought
the fish was well hooked was a rotten snag. Koku
was busy himself with a nibble just then or he
might have angered his old friend by laughing.
He might also have driven all the fish away, for
when Koku laughed he could be heard for half
a mile at least!</p>

<p>“What yo’ got, boy?” asked the disgruntled
Rad Sampson. “A rubber boot?”</p>

<p>But Koku had caught a fine, shining perch and
he began dancing around the tiny enclosed lawn
in great delight.</p>

<p>“Stop dat ghost-dancing!” exclaimed Rad.
“String dat fish on dat withe. Dat’s only de fust
one. Mars’ Tom hisself can eat a dozen ob dem
for his supper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“Sh!” hissed Koku suddenly, putting up a
great hand in warning.</p>

<p>He had landed on one splay foot and he stood
there, with the other one raised, bent forward and
listening. He had heard something beyond the
hazel hedge. As Rad often said, Koku ought to
possess the most wonderful hearing—his ears
were big enough!</p>

<p>In a moment he crept toward the repeated
sound, his movements as soundless as those of
a hunting cat. Rad came close behind him,
trying to suppress a rather asthmatic breath
and stepping as though he were walking on
eggs. The sound was repeated—a little splashing.</p>

<p>Through an opening in the brush Rad suddenly
caught sight of a moving object. He grabbed
Koku’s bare and hairy wrist.</p>

<p>“Hold hard, big man!” he gasped. “Dat’s a
bear!”</p>

<p>They were almost within stone’s throw of civilization,
and there had not been a bear heard of
in that part of the State for fifty years; nevertheless,
Rad was convinced of the presence of
Bruin.</p>

<p>“A bear?” muttered the giant, not quite sure
what the word meant. His knowledge of anything
but the commonest English terms was
meagre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>The thing beyond the bushes moved. It was
down beside the lake itself, and Rad was sure it
must be drinking.</p>

<p>“Yo’ look out, giant!” he whispered warningly
to the giant.</p>

<p>But there was nothing much that Koku was
really afraid of save spirits and magic. Any
animal smaller than an elephant or rhinoceros he
was not much afraid to attack. He uttered a
challenging yell, leaped almost straight up in the
air, and went over the hedge of hazel brush as
though from a spring-board.</p>

<p>It is fortunate he did not land upon Eradicate
Sampson’s “bear.” That individual likewise uttered
a yell and leaped away from the giant with
much agility.</p>

<p>“Whoo! Ketch him!” shouted Eradicate,
charging through the bushes. “Don’t let him
git away, boy!”</p>

<p>But the giant remained rooted where he had
landed upon the sandy beach. Almost at his feet,
floating on the surface of the quiet water, was
a polished piece of hollow bamboo to which a
pair of inflated bladders was attached—one on
either side of the stick.</p>

<p>“Mars’ Tom!” shrieked Eradicate Sampson.</p>

<p>“Master no bear—what you say!” exclaimed
Koku angrily. “Koku jump on him, he be all
smashed up. Rad old fool!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“Hey!” cried Tom Swift, with some heat.
“You big clown! Don’t be so quick to jump on
anything or anybody. Even a bear has some
rights that you are bound to respect. And you,
Rad, why did you sic him onto me?”</p>

<p>“Nebber did such a thing!” declared Rad
warmly. “Nobody but a big fool giant would try
to jump right down a bear’s throat widout lookin’
whar he was jumpin’! Huh!”</p>

<p>Koku likewise snorted his disgust. As usual,
the two tried to lay the fault on each other. But
Tom came back with a grin on his face.</p>

<p>“I certainly did think a flying pterodactyl, or
something of the kind, was swooping over those
bushes to get me,” he declared.</p>

<p>“He’s sure wuss nor dat,” declared Rad solemnly.
“He’s wuss nor a terrydicktil—sure is.
He’s wuss dan a locofoco.”</p>

<p>Koku rolled his eyes tremendously at the sound
of these big words which he no more understood
than Rad himself did. Tom hastened to relieve
the giant’s feelings to a degree.</p>

<p>“How many fish did you boys catch?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“All lak’ Mist’ Damon cotched when he went
to Florida after tarpon. One!” chuckled Rad.
“Mist’ Damon said he was two days cotchin’
dat one; an’ when he seen how big it was he
thought he ought t’ve spent a week at it. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
Koku actin’ like it was de on’y fish ever caught
in dis lake,” he added, with scorn.</p>

<p>“Well, go on, you two, with your fishing,”
said Tom. “I’ve a problem to think out and I
don’t want to be bothered by either pterodactyls
or locofocos. Get along now.”</p>

<p>He plumped himself down on the sand again
and fixed his gaze upon the bobbing piece of bamboo
and the inflated bladders. Tom had known,
without his father’s declaration to that effect, that
one of the chief problems he had to solve in the
matter of building a better flying boat than anybody
else was the problem of constructing his
invention so that it could settle in a rough sea
without being capsized.</p>

<p>The puzzling thought was with him, day and
night. It ran in his head like a tune that sometimes
seems to fill one’s mind to the expulsion
of everything else. Yet, when the young inventor
was left alone again and tried to settle
himself to his problem in statics, his thought
weaved a pattern something like this:</p>

<p>“A shell of some light metal—aluminum, we’ll
say—buoyed on the outside by additional air
chambers. Humph, it would look extremely awkward.
But, as Mr. Nestor says very often, the
look of a thing isn’t what counts. Poor Mr.
Nestor! What will those two women do if he
does not live?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“How about double walls from stem to stern
for air chambers? Humph! Bless my blown-up
bladders! as Mr. Damon might say,” and he
chuckled. “Mr. Damon catching a tarpon so big
that he thought he should have spent a week landing
it. Humph!</p>

<p>“And he starts in a day or two for Iceland.
Br-r-r! That’s one cold country, I bet! Cold!
Iceland! Why, if Mr. Nestor went there for a
few weeks—Great Scott!” exclaimed Tom Swift,
suddenly rising and forgetting all about his bamboo
stick and pigs’ bladders floating on the lake.</p>

<p>“What have I been thinking of? Wakefield
Damon is just the man for us!”</p>

<p>He started away from the lake at top speed,
forgetting for the time all about his plans for a
flying boat that would astonish the world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<span class="fs80">THE EXPEDITION SETS OFF</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Tom Swift was quite sure that Mr. Wakefield
Damon had not been up from Waterfield since
the specialist had diagnosed Mr. Nestor’s trouble,
and probably had not heard of Dr. Raddiker’s
advice. The last Tom had heard from his eccentric
friend, he was making preparations to leave
for New York very shortly.</p>

<p>The young inventor did not even halt at the
house to tell his father what he purposed doing;
but he got out his electric runabout and made as
good time as the town speed ordinance allowed
to Mary Nestor’s house.</p>

<p>Mary and her mother were in no more cheerful
state of mind than they had been when Tom
had last seen them. They had canvassed all the
possible ways they could think of to bring about
the desired trip for Mr. Nestor into the North,
but had accomplished nothing.</p>

<p>“Every way seems shut by a door that is barred
and locked, Tom,” sighed Mary to her sympathetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
friend. “We do not know what to do.”</p>

<p>“Put on your hat and jacket and come for a
ride,” proposed the young fellow.</p>

<p>“But that won’t help father,” she complained.
“And I ought not to take you from your work
and let you drive me about the country. It isn’t
right.”</p>

<p>“The trouble with you, Mary,” said Tom,
grinning, “more than anything else, is your New
England conscience. Don’t worry about what is
right so much. Come on. I have a reason for
taking you for a ride to-day.”</p>

<p>When they were on the road and she knew that
he was heading for Waterfield and Mr. Damon’s
house she expressed satisfaction. She was fond
of Mr. Damon, and that eccentric gentleman was
fond of Mary.</p>

<p>“But I feel condemned, Tom, when I go around
to see people and talk and laugh—as one will—and
then remember that father is so poorly and
that there seems so little chance of his ever recovering
his health.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe that Raddiker knew what he
was talking about?”</p>

<p>“I do, indeed. The other doctors have much
confidence in him. He is a wonderful scientist.
They say they wonder why he came over here
when he was so successful and so much admired
for his knowledge in Austria.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“I know why he came,” grumbled Tom, who
could not bring himself to like Dr. Raddiker after
his experience with him. “The same reason that
all those foreigners come over here. A million
kronen is worth about two cents of our money.
And then they say that Americans are so mercenary!”</p>

<p>“Well, it does not seem that his pointing out
the trouble with father is going to help save him,”
sighed Mary.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure about that,” rejoined Tom
with a change of tone. “Here is Mr. Damon’s
place. Look at the trunks and packing boxes on
the porch. Does he intend to take all those with
him to Denmark?”</p>

<p>There seemed to be a wonderful amount of stir
around the Damon premises. Mrs. Damon, who
had long since ceased to interfere when her husband
got the wanderlust, sat placidly in a rocking
chair and weaved back and forth, knitting.
She was the only calm looking object around the
place, for even the hens were running and squawking
in the yard as Mr. Damon’s serving man
darted back and forth, subject to his employer’s
call.</p>

<p>“Bless my spring-heel boots!” ejaculated Mr.
Damon, rushing out to greet the two visitors.
“Time is flying and I am so busy that I can’t
think of half the things I want to do before my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
departure for New York. I was afraid I should
not see either of you young folks again——</p>

<p>“Bless my optic nerve, Mary! how sweet you
are looking. Isn’t she, Mrs. Damon? Won’t
you both get out?”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Mary promptly, taking her cue
from Tom Swift’s look. “I must talk to Mrs.
Damon.”</p>

<p>“Do so—do so,” cried the gentleman. “Maybe
she will answer you; but I don’t often get a reply
from her,” and he burst into one of his laughs.
“Bless my wagging tongue! She says she does
not get a chance to say a word until I am run
down.”</p>

<p>He saw instantly that Tom had something serious
on his mind. Mr. Damon was not at all
an unobservant man. He whispered when Mary
had run up the path to the porch:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Tom, my boy? Is Nestor
worse?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that he is. But they have had
the consultation with the foreign doctor.”</p>

<p>“With that specialist?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He came to Shopton. A funny fellow,
but the other doctors think he knows all about
Mr. Nestor’s complaint.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded Mr. Damon. “A
very queer case! Bless my thermometer, a very
queer case!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“As far as I can see,” grumbled Tom Swift,
“it is just as queer now—or queerer—than it
was before Dr. Raddiker came.”</p>

<p>“Ah-ha!” ejaculated Mr. Damon. “The famous
Dr. Raddiker, the European scientist?
Bless my medical dictionary! he is a wonderful
man.”</p>

<p>“Yes? Well, maybe. But he has exploded a
regular medical bomb in the Nestor household.
He says the only sure cure for Mr. Nestor’s complaint
is for him to leave home.”</p>

<p>“Change of climate, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Very much so. The temperature isn’t right
for him here. He has got to go where the quicksilver
takes a toboggan to the bottom of the
glass.”</p>

<p>“Bless my thermostat! You don’t mean——?”</p>

<p>“That is it, exactly,” Tom assured him. “Dr.
Raddiker declared the only cure for this disease
is a cold climate—a much colder climate than
ours. And that Mr. Nestor will have to remain
in that colder climate for several weeks, if not
months. Now, you know that Mrs. Nestor could
never stand such an experience. Her bronchial
trouble would be aggravated.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Nestor cannot go alone. Her mother
would never feel comfortable an hour if Mary
went with him, even to the North Cape,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
for instance. It is not to be thought of.”</p>

<p>“Bless my chilblains!” interrupted Mr. Damon
excitedly. “If it is a cold country he needs, and
all that, what could be finer than Iceland?”</p>

<p>“At least,” chuckled Tom Swift, “the name of
that island is most suggestive.”</p>

<p>“And from all I have managed to learn, for
a good part of the year it is cold enough up there
to satisfy the most critical polar bear.”</p>

<p>“True for you.”</p>

<p>“He’s going with me, Tom, if he can travel.
Of course he will!” cried Mr. Damon, jumping
as usual to a decision which might change all his
plans save that dealing with his destination.</p>

<p>But that was his way. Nothing was ever too
much trouble for Wakefield Damon to do for
a friend. He at once halted his preparations and
rode back to Shopton with Tom and Mary,
squeezed in between them on the narrow seat of
the runabout, and interviewed the physicians that
were attending Mr. Nestor.</p>

<p>What he learned about the chance Mr. Nestor
had of surviving such a journey as was proposed
satisfied Mr. Damon that he could take a chance
with the invalid. When he went to the Nestor
house and told the family in his blusterous way
that he proposed bearing the sick man off with
him, as a prisoner if need be, he scattered the
gloom of that household most effectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“You are the dearest man who ever lived!”
cried Mary, throwing herself into his arms.</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell Tom that,” threatened Mr.
Damon. “Bless my love-knots, but that is the
greatest compliment I ever had.”</p>

<p>Mary blushed, but her eyes shone upon him
just the same. Mrs. Nestor was very grateful.
The declaration made the most impression on the
sick man.</p>

<p>“To Denmark and Iceland?” he said. “Places
I have never seen! I shall like it. You give
me a chance for life, I do believe, Brother
Damon.”</p>

<p>“Never mind the sugar-plums,” replied Mr. Damon.
“We’ve got to go in a hurry, for there is
a certain steamship I want to take. Bless my
seven-league boots! but we have got to do some
tall traveling.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was all over and the invalid had been carried
off by the boisterous Wakefield Damon.
Tom Swift stood with Mary and her mother on
the porch of their house and watched the two
taxicabs, with the travelers and the baggage, disappear
toward the railroad station. Mr. Nestor
would not hear to any of them following him to
the train.</p>

<p>“I hope everything will be all right with him,”
sighed Mrs. Nestor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>“Well, everything will be all right with us
here!” cried Mary, smiling at Tom. “We have
Tom to look out for us.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Tom is such a help,” agreed the anxious
woman. “But I hope Dr. Raddiker was right.
It is a long way to Iceland, and the cold sea voyage
may do him more harm than good.”</p>

</div>

<p>“You have convinced yourself that this amount
will finance the great scheme, have you, Tom?”
asked Ned Newton, leaning back in his chair in
the private office of the Swift Construction Company
at Shopton. “We can’t be too particular
about the financial end of it.”</p>

<p>“All right, Old Cerberus,” laughed Tom Swift,
who called his friend everything from the
“Watchdog of the Treasury” to “Tightwad, the
Penny Squeezer.” “I’ve told you how far I have
gone. I have O.K.’d several contracts for parts
of the <em>Winged Arrow</em>——”</p>

<p>“Is that going to be the name of the boat?”</p>

<p>“I think so. We have to call her something.
I am going to lay her keel—the keel of her boat-cabin—within
the fortnight, if circumstances permit.
If I don’t fall down on it, Ned, she is going
to be a worthy craft!”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” Ned rejoined loyally. “You
would not waste your time on anything mediocre,
I am sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“Many, many thanks,” returned Tom, getting
up to bow to his treasurer.</p>

<p>“But tell me more about it. Let’s have the
particulars,” said Ned, with interest.</p>

<p>“I will give you a few figures to consider,”
Tom said promptly, picking up a paper from his
desk and reading from it. “The boat will be
sixty feet long. That is about the length of the
keel. She will have cabin space for ten or twelve
people. I plan to have the wings spread at least
one hundred and ten feet. She will be driven by
two Liberty motors, each of four hundred horsepower.
If I can’t get a hundred miles an hour
speed out of her I shall be gravely disappointed.”</p>

<p>“Whew! Some boat!” muttered Ned. “But
if it is practical, we may make some money out
of it.”</p>

<p>“Miser!” chuckled Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Just spending money for
the fun of it will get you nowhere,” said Ned
soberly. “It is going to cost a pretty penny. But
if you can sell it to the Government, for instance;
or some government——”</p>

<p>“Whatever I build, is at the service of our
country,” Tom said promptly. “But I am not
going to peddle my inventions to other nations.
I don’t need to.”</p>

<p>“‘Pride goeth before a fall,’” quoted Ned
Newton. “The time may come when the Swift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
Construction Company will need cash. Then
these experiments of yours will breed some
ducats.”</p>

<p>“This flying boat is my pet project, Ned,”
Tom said soberly. “I believe a deal of experimenting
is going on all over the world in the
constructing of seaplanes. It is the most practical
end of the flying game.”</p>

<p>“So it appears.”</p>

<p>“Then, we want to keep in the lead. The Swift
Construction Company ought to put out a boat
that will lead them all, even if we never make a
penny out of it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk that way!” urged Ned. “Our
books have got to show a balance on the right
side at the end of the year. Go ahead. Do all
the experimenting you want. But in the end,
Tom Swift, I shall expect you to evolve something
that will pay the company <em>big</em>.”</p>

<p>In secret Tom believed that was exactly what
he should do. But he did not like to be too sanguine.
After all, a good many of the ideas he
had evolved regarding the new invention were
so embryonic that he hesitated to go into particulars
about them with Ned, or even with his
father.</p>

<p>Barton Hopkins had been a dreamer, like his
son, in his younger days. But age usually makes
a man critical. Tom did not want anybody to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
tell him a thing could not be done until he had
tried it out himself and was satisfied that it was
impossible.</p>

<p>During these days after the departure of Mr.
Damon and Mary’s father for Denmark Tom
lived in a good deal of a mental haze. He allowed
nothing, at least, to interfere any more with his
consideration of the new invention. Rad Sampson
declared that the younger Swift was so absorbed
by his work that he did not know what
he ate half the time.</p>

<p>“Dat boy sartain sure work hisself sick,”
grumbled the old colored man. “Dem things he
is playin’ wid take all his mind off’n ’portant
things. Suah do!”</p>

<p>To Rad the pleasures of the table were far
more important than the building of a flying boat
that was to astonish the world.</p>

<p>“Some shingles an’ pigs’ bladders and pieces
of string—huh!” grumbled Rad. “Let dis yere
Koku play wid ’em. They jest de sort ob things
childern and heathens plays wid. I’s ’shamed of
Mars’ Tom.”</p>

<p>The model Tom had built upon his bedroom
table, however, was all that Rad saw of the flying
boat. It was merely a rough suggestion of what
the young inventor hoped the <em>Winged Arrow</em>
would be when it was done. In one of the locked
rooms attached to his office suite at the works<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
he was working out in full detail the mysterious
seaplane.</p>

<p>The workmen, even the most trusted ones, had
little idea as yet as to what Tom Swift was about.
But when a part of the erecting shop was cleared
for the keel of the big boat they all grew excited.
The Swift Construction Company was
about to evolve another wonder!</p>

<p>When Tom himself appeared in the erecting
shop in working clothes the men might well be
sure that something of importance was under
way. There was another sign that never failed.
Koku, the giant, was close at hand.</p>

<p>The strange fellow had believed for a long time
now that his beloved young “Master” was threatened
by malign enemies, both of a physical and
spiritual kind. No talking to Koku or explanation
of religious matters could convince the giant
that there were not actual “devils,” as well as evil
influences, at work in the world.</p>

<p>Tom had been in so many perils from certain
evil people who were opposed to the Government
during the war, and who were the young inventor’s
personal enemies as well, that the poor savage
expected harm to come to his master at any
and all times.</p>

<p>When Tom was working around machinery or
engaged in any matter where there were other
men about—especially rough looking men—Koku<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
did not intend to be far away from Tom
Swift. He watched the young fellow and all
those who approached him with a gaze as sharp
as that of a lynx.</p>

<p>Sometimes Tom turned around quickly to find
the giant almost at his elbow, his savage gaze
enough to startle any one. Koku’s eyes had the
quality of a cat’s. They narrowed to a wicked
slit in the daytime, and were yellow. At night
they expanded and were glowing, and it had often
been proved that he could see farther and more
distinctly in the dark than any American of European
descent.</p>

<p>As Tom moved about briskly, appointing each
man his task, advising here and ordering there,
Koku was sometimes quite put to it to keep within
arm’s reach of his master. But, at least, he never
lost sight of him, and the giant could move so
quickly and lightly that he was seldom in anybody’s
way.</p>

<p>Having selected most of his mechanics with
much care and after giving heedful attention to
their characters as well as to their ability as workmen,
Tom had no suspicion at this time that a
single man in the works felt any enmity toward
him. He laughed with his father and with Ned
Newton, therefore, over Koku’s careful watch
upon him and those about him.</p>

<p>And yet, there arose a situation, totally unexpected,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
almost inexplicable, which might have
been considered with justice a direct attempt to
injure the young inventor. And in the thrilling
action of the moment in question it seemed that
Tom Swift would neither carry through his attempt
to build a wonderful flying boat nor accomplish
any other future marvel.</p>

<p>Certain steel trusses were being arranged along
the measured length of the floor of the shop devoted
to the laying of the keel. The keel had
reached Shopton in sections, and nobody outside
the works could have guessed what the shining
metal parts were as the trucks brought them from
the railroad to the shops.</p>

<p>The traveling crane picked up these numbered
parts of the keel and in succession delivered them
to the gang handling the emplacement on the
trusses. The prow was railroaded to the far end
of the building and eased into place. The second
section was brought forward.</p>

<p>The gang was busy with this while the crane,
traveling upon an overhead rail, was supposed
to drift down the length of the shop again, drawn
by the power of the stationary engine. The crane
and its swinging hooks and loops of chain traveled
almost silently.</p>

<p>No workman around the keel noted that the
crane stopped half way to the door of the shop.
It seemed to have fouled, for it stopped abruptly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
and the overhead rail shivered through its entire
length.</p>

<p>Tom had mounted to one of the trusses and
with voice and gesture was advising his helpers
how he wished the last piece of the keel placed.
The clanging of other machinery, the echo of
hammers, the roar of escaping steam, well nigh
deafened them all.</p>

<p>Of a sudden Koku, the giant, emitted a shriek
that might have been envied by a steam locomotive!
He leaped directly at Tom. He hurdled
two of the trusses as though they were no higher
than croquet hoops, and with broad-spread arms
and clutching hands, lunged at the young inventor.</p>

<p>“Look out there, Mr. Tom!” cried one of the
men, making his voice heard even above Koku’s
roar. “That giant’s gone crazy!”</p>

<p>Before the young fellow could turn to see what
was threatening him, Koku was upon him and
had seized him in his mighty arms.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<span class="fs80">BAD LUCK</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The great leap of the excited giant carried
him under and beyond the overhead rail from
which the traveling crane hung. The wind of
the rebounding crane seemed to sweep Koku and
Tom aside. They escaped the swinging hooks
and chains by a very close margin.</p>

<p>But all of the unobservant workmen were not
so fortunate. Two of them were knocked senseless
by the chain, one with a broken shoulder
blade, the other with a cut on his head that bled
profusely. Several others were knocked down.</p>

<p>Tom was up with a yell, wrenched himself
from Koku’s grasp, and started down the shop
with the speed of a deer.</p>

<p>“Who did that? Stop your engine! Throw
off the power!” he yelled.</p>

<p>But already the man in charge of the power
governing the crane had come to his senses. He
had thrown over the lever and shut off the power.
The swinging loops of heavy steel links were now
at the far end of the shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>The accident was, for a time, seemingly inexplicable.
The crane traveling toward the shop
door had been seemingly stuck. The controller
had been thrown twice to start it. And when
the fouled crane had started, it had rushed backward
instead of forward. Only Koku’s sharp
gaze had observed it, and his quick action had
saved Tom Swift from disaster.</p>

<p>An ambulance was sent for to take the two
more seriously injured men to the hospital.
Meanwhile the general opinion in the erecting
shop was that a deliberate attempt had been made
against the young inventor’s life.</p>

<p>Koku glared at everybody who came anywhere
near his master. He marched up and down
within a stride or two of Tom, and flexed his
big muscles and muttered threats in his own
tongue. The half civilized creature, who was
usually the mildest person imaginable, had now
become a figure to strike terror to the bravest.</p>

<p>Before anything further was done to the keel
of the flying boat Tom made an exhaustive examination
of the traveling crane, the cables attached
to it, and the steel rail from which its truck hung.
He trusted the engineman, who was an old employee.
And he could not think of any man or
boy about the erecting shop that wished the company—or
himself—ill.</p>

<p>“It’s a jinx, boss,” declared one of the older<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
men. “Bad luck! And I have a feeling in my
bones that it’s only the beginning.”</p>

<p>“Come, Carney!” commanded Tom Swift.
“You take something to get rid of any such feeling.
Don’t talk that way and let the other men
hear you. Of course there is a perfectly reasonable
explanation of the accident.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t stop it from being bad luck just
the same,” muttered the man.</p>

<p>A thorough scrutiny of the line of the crane’s
travel finally resulted in a single explanation of
the accident. Tom picked up a loop of steel cable—a
piece perhaps two feet long when straightened—which
showed marks of the wheels of the
traveler.</p>

<p>“This loop must have been left hanging to the
rail by some careless repair man and, after that
last trip of the crane, it shifted and slid along
the rail to that spot where the machinery fouled,”
Tom declared.</p>

<p>“Now, somebody is at fault in this. It has
cost the Swift Construction a great deal of money
for employees’ compensation, as well as the wage
loss for this breakdown. If I ever find out who
the careless man is, I’ll fire him. Carelessness is
the most dangerous thing in the world. Our lives
are not safe when such a man is around. Now
let’s see what more we can do about laying this
keel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>It did seem, however, as though the old machinist
had somehow hit it right about the
“jinx.” Bad luck seemed to accompany the assembling
of the body of the flying boat. Little
accidents happened daily. Men were hurt, tools
were broken, delays occurred. Tom got into a
touchy state that even Ned Newton recognized.</p>

<p>“You’d better knock off on this flying boat and
get a change of action,” Ned advised. “Go somewhere
with Mary and her mother. Take a rest.”</p>

<p>“You’d better take a rest yourself,” returned
Tom sharply, but grinning. “I would fly all to
pieces just now if I had to be idle. You know
how it is with me, Ned. I have to work it off.
And I can think or talk about nothing now but
the <em>Winged Arrow</em>.”</p>

<p>“It looks to me,” said the pessimistic Ned,
“that that is one arrow that will never be shot.
I have been looking it over, and all it seems to
be is a great pontoon—as clumsy as can be.”</p>

<p>“You are a cheerful beggar!” snapped Tom
Swift. “What do you expect to see at this stage
of the work, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“Well, two things I hate to see are the bills
and the labor-cost account,” grumbled Ned.
“You are going to strain the credit of this company
before you get through, Tom.”</p>

<p>“It’s lucky dad and I held onto so much of
the stock,” rejoined the young inventor, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
sudden grin. “We are the only two with vision.
You are terribly sordid, Ned.”</p>

<p>“I’m terribly practical,” grumbled his friend.
“Money is one of the hardest things to get hold
of and the slipperiest things to hold on to in the
world. I wish I could impress these facts on
your mind.”</p>

<p>“Say not so!” gibed Tom. “Them cruel words
break me hear-r-r-t, Ned. Wait till you see the
<em>Winged Arrow</em> take to the air from Lake Carlopa——-”</p>

<p>“Wait till I do!” exclaimed Ned, and for once
the friends were so far apart in their opinions
that they almost quarreled.</p>

<p>Koku lurked about the shop day and night on
the watch for somebody or something that tried
to trouble his young master.</p>

<p>“Him evil one at work,” the giant declared to
Rad Sampson.</p>

<p>“Lawsy-marcy!” grumbled Rad, rolling his
eyes. “Yo’ suah has a close’t acquaintance wid
Ol’ Satan, Koku. How’d yo’ git dat way?”</p>

<p>A fire started among some oil-soaked waste behind
the stationary engine in the erecting shop.
A power belt stripped unexpectedly and balled up
the machinery for most of one day. Certain castings
were discovered to have faults in them that
would have endangered the success of the flying
boat if the faults had not been seen in time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>Altogether a less determined fellow than Tom
Swift would possibly have been tempted to abandon
his plans—at least, for the time being. But
the young inventor was utterly given up to the
building of the flying boat, and nothing but personal
disaster would have stopped him.</p>

<p>The work did go on apace, after all. Tom’s
energy and ingenuity were sufficient for the accomplishment
of a deal that might seem impossible
to men much older than himself. As his
plans developed for the flying boat, he worked
harder and for longer hours. Mary declared that
he even neglected her.</p>

<p>The young girl realized, however, that her
father’s illness had delayed Tom’s beginning upon
his new invention. Now he felt that he must
work the harder to make up the lost time.</p>

<p>Mary and her mother were getting accustomed
to the idea of Mr. Nestor’s absence. Besides
receiving a cheerful letter written by the invalid
before he sailed from New York with Mr. Damon
for Denmark, they had received two wireless
messages sent while the travelers were at sea.</p>

<p>Then followed a considerable wait before the
letter arrived from Denmark describing the voyage
and explaining how they were to reach Iceland
the following month. Mr. Nestor was much
more cheerful and was feeling better already. He
said that Mr. Damon was blessing everything in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
the universe because of their delays, but that they
hoped to reach Iceland and the village of Rosestone
while the weather was still comparatively
mild.</p>

<p>Of course Tom Swift was interested in all that
Mary was interested in. Nevertheless he had
pretty well put out of his mind any anxiety for
the invalid. He believed that Mr. Nestor was in
very capable hands, for the eccentricities of
Wakefield Damon did not keep him from being a
loyal friend and a jolly traveling companion.</p>

<p>As Mr. Barton Swift said, Tom ate, slept, and
lived <em>flying boat</em>! Nothing else in the world
seemed just then of so much importance as the
building of the <em>Winged Arrow</em>, which was the
name Tom had selected for the seaplane.</p>

<p>“If the craft accomplished the speed Tom expects,
she will be well named,” the elder Swift
said in confidence to Ned Newton.</p>

<p>Secretly Ned was quite as proud of his chum’s
ability and brains as was Tom’s father. But he
felt it his duty to put brakes on whenever he saw
a great amount of money being risked in an enterprise
that might toe a fizzle in the end.</p>

<p>To Tom’s mind the weeks passed with astonishing
celerity. Mary was looking for news from
Iceland when the huge flying boat was removed
in sections from the erecting shop and trundled
down to the edge of Lake Carlopa on trucks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>There it was once more put together on the
ways, every part tested for faults, the motors put
aboard and connected with the propellers, and
then, like any ship, she was launched into the
water. It was a gala day in Shopton when the
marvel was given her first bath. The works closed
down and everybody connected with the Swift
Construction Company was on hand to see the
launching.</p>

<p>Mary Nestor broke the bottle of grape juice
on the nose of the <em>Winged Arrow</em> as she struck
the water and was splashed in return by the
water as the plane “made a hole” in the lake.</p>

<p>It was a rough and windy day when this took
place; but the boat merely rocked gently upon
the surface after that first splash. It made a
very brave appearance indeed.</p>

<p>“Mebbe the jinx is finished,” said Carney, the
old workman, in confidence when the launching
was over. “Anyway, we got the thing out of the
shops without killing anybody. And that’s a
good thing.”</p>

<p>Tom Swift was not thinking about Carney’s
“jinx” on this day. He was much too deeply
absorbed in the fact of the boat’s being in the
water. Then, too, he had a small puzzle in his
mind while the ceremony of launching was taking
place.</p>

<p>In the crowd of spectators was a man whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
face he knew. The man watched proceedings
with an exceedingly keen scrutiny. His interest
in the huge flying boat was professional, Tom
was sure. He began to have some uneasiness
about the man, for, although he was sure he had
seen him before, Tom Swift could not remember
where he had seen him or what his name was.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE TRIAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Ned Newton took dinner at the Swift house
that evening, and in the course of the meal he
asked Tom:</p>

<p>“Did you chance to see a man in a frock coat,
a gardenia in his buttonhole, and wearing a top
hat at the lake to-day? Little peaked black mustache
and a whisp of goatee? Rather Frenchy
looking.”</p>

<p>“He is just the chap I have been worrying
about!” exclaimed the young inventor.</p>

<p>“Why worry about him?” demanded Ned,
while even Mr. Swift looked at his son in some
surprise.</p>

<p>“Because it worries me to know that I’ve seen
a man but am unable to place him. Do you have
any idea, Ned, who he is?”</p>

<p>“That is what I was asking you—or attempting
to,” returned Ned.</p>

<p>“He knows seaplanes, at least,” observed Tom.
“I must have seen him—or his picture, perhaps.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“He was a complete stranger to me,” declared
Ned.</p>

<p>“His face is familiar to me. And I am a bit
scary of him,” confessed Tom. “He looked the
new boat over as though he understood everything
about her. Humph! There are some unpatented
parts that I would not care to have
stolen.”</p>

<p>“The man could scarcely steal them <em>in his eye</em>,”
remarked Mr. Swift.</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that. But it may be that
because of trouble we have had in the past, I am
suspicious with little cause.”</p>

<p>“You have caught that from Koku,” laughed
Ned Newton.</p>

<p>“Maybe the boy is more than half right,” rejoined
Tom, referring to the giant. “Carney, in
the shops, has said he ‘had a feeling in his bones’
that there was a ‘jinx’ on the boat. Humph!
I have to say I don’t believe in such things—”</p>

<p>“Whether you do believe in evil spirits or not?”
interposed Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, that may be so. After all, admitting
the existence of bad luck is to encourage it, they
say. But that has nothing much to do with the
dapper little man with the spike mustache and
goatee and the flower in his buttonhole. He was
spick and span——”</p>

<p>“Like most Frenchmen? That is one reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
why I almost always like the French,” declared
Ned.</p>

<p>“I’d just like to know who he is,” repeated
Tom. “Anyway, I am going to ask you, Ned,
to increase the special guards about the cove over
there where the plane rests. I am not yet ready
to give other people the benefit of my discoveries.”</p>

<p>“So Koku is not guard enough?” chuckled
Ned Newton.</p>

<p>“He has to sleep once in a while. Besides, a
well dressed man awes Koku a whole lot,” and
Tom smiled. “And this chap you speak of could
put it all over the innocent savage.”</p>

<p>They decided to have a special number of
guards who should remain at the cove where the
launching had taken place, at least, until the time
of the try-out. And Tom and his men strained
every effort to complete the flying boat and send
it into the air as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Tom kept three shifts a day at work. But
only the most skilled of his men could be trusted
on the job, so the crews were small. However,
there was not an hour of the twenty-four save
from Saturday evening until Monday morning
when the hammers did not ring or the steam
drills puff or the riveters clatter on the <em>Winged
Arrow</em>.</p>

<p>That shore of Lake Carlopa became a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
popular resort for sightseers during the ensuing
fortnight. The newspapers had got hold of the
idea that Tom Swift was about to reveal to the
world another marvel, and the reporters would
have annoyed the young inventor a good deal had
it not been for Ned Newton.</p>

<p>Ned believed in a certain amount of publicity,
and the stories he furnished the newspaper reporters,
if not particularly scientific, were at least
interesting. Tom Swift’s new flying boat was a
first page leader for several days before the test
day.</p>

<p>Tom was watchful for the reappearance of the
man whose presence at the launching had disturbed
him; but the French looking person did
not again come to the cove. At least, Tom did
not see the stranger. And as the hour approached
when the <em>Winged Arrow</em> would be ready for her
trial flight the young inventor gradually forgot all
outside matters. He did not even go to the Nestor
house to learn if the invalid and Mr. Damon had
been heard from again. He began to sleep aboard
the flying boat, as the cabin was practically finished.</p>

<p>This central portion of the pontoon, or boat,
was arranged so as to utilize every inch of space.
There were folding berths for eight. The cabin
could be divided by a curtain if passengers of
opposite sexes were included in any party. Meals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
for officers and passengers would be served here,
too, the galley being directly aft.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to the ordinary sailing
craft, the quarters of the crew of the <em>Winged
Arrow</em> were in her tail, or after-part. These machinists
would be furnished hammocks to sleep
in. The prow of the boat, where the mechanism
of the powerful searchlights was housed, was
built of well-leaded glass so that an unobstructed
view ahead and above, as well as below and on
either side, could be obtained.</p>

<p>As the huge machine floated on the water of
the lake cove, it seemed very awkward and as
though it would be unmanageable. The opinions
of sightseers who came to stare were as amusing
as they were often silly. It seemed to be the
consensus of these opinions that Tom Swift
never intended to try to fly the huge boat, but
that it was merely a “stock jobbing” scheme. It
was told that stock in the Swift Construction
Company was being sold at fabulous prices on
the strength of this flying boat that was doomed
to failure.</p>

<p>“Gee!” ejaculated Ned Newton, hearing this,
“I wish it was as easy to sell shares in a bona
fide invention as these people seem to think it is
in a fake. Money would be easy enough to
raise.”</p>

<p>It was true that a fortune—and not a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
fortune—had been expended upon the building
of the <em>Winged Arrow</em>. The treasurer of the
Swift Construction Company might well be
anxious.</p>

<p>“If she’s a fizzle, Tom, my boy,” he said
mournfully, “we’ll all have to go into bankruptcy.”</p>

<p>“She may not be an unqualified success right
at the start,” rejoined the young inventor, with
confidence. “But I mean to make her fly and
sail and make a proper landing on the earth and
water before I am through.”</p>

<p>The morning of the day on which the test flight
of the new plane was to occur, Tom Swift was
awakened at eight o’clock, a late hour for him,
by the ringing of his private radio-telephone. He
rolled over in bed and grabbed the instrument,
removed the receiver and sleepily shouted:</p>

<p>“Hullo!”</p>

<p>“Tom Swift?” came the voice over the wire—a
voice that was quite unfamiliar to the inventor.</p>

<p>“Speaking,” replied Tom, yawning. “Excuse
me. Who is it?”</p>

<p>“That does not matter—just now,” said the
voice clearly. “I want you to do me a favor.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“I understand you mean to try out your new
seaplane to-day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“That is a private matter,” returned Tom,
awakened now to full caution.</p>

<p>“Agreed. But I would like the chance of going
with you on the try-out.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Tom, in amazement
“You want to join my mechanics and myself on
what may be a dangerous voyage?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. I am interested in your invention.
I may be more interested when I see personally
how it works. And if that is so——”</p>

<p>“Well, sir?” shot in Tom, not at all pleased.</p>

<p>“If the plane acts as you seem to think it will,
I may be able to finance your building several of
the machines and under circumstances that will
make it well worth your while to sign a contract.”</p>

<p>Tom got a grip on himself almost at once.
He replied in a most casual way:</p>

<p>“I am not at all sure that you could interest
me in any such proposition, even if I knew who
you were and was assured of your good intent.
In the first place, this is an entirely private venture,
and I have no thought of selling the plane,
or any like it. It may be some time before I consider
the machine perfect. In any case, I do not
know you——”</p>

<p>“Tell me that I am to be one of your sailing
party and I will present my credentials,” interrupted
the strange voice quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>Naturally Tom Swift had thought, as soon as
he was fully awakened, of the dapper man whose
presence at the launching of the <em>Winged Arrow</em>
had puzzled both Ned Newton and himself. Although
the man had the appearance of a foreigner,
this voice betrayed not the least accent.
The English used seemed meticulously correct,
which is, however, a mark sometimes of the speech
of well educated foreigners.</p>

<p>“I can make no arrangements over the telephone,”
Tom said bluntly. “Especially with people
of whose identity I know nothing. In addition,
in the present case, and regarding your request,
I must refuse absolutely. Nobody goes
with me on the test trip save chosen workmen
and Mr. Newton. I must distinctly say No!”
concluded Tom.</p>

<p>“If ready cash would be an object?” began the
voice again, but Tom said once more: “No, sir!”
and closed the receiver.</p>

<p>But all the time he was bathing and dressing,
and even while he was eating Rad Sampson’s
cakes and chops, the young inventor puzzled his
brain over the incident and the possible identity
of the person who had awakened him.</p>

<p>“He is keeping mighty close tabs on me, whoever
he is,” thought Tom. “Even knew I had
this radio-telephone installed on the boat. And
he must represent somebody with plenty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
money. Humph, I wonder what the game really
is!</p>

<p>“Business rivals, I presume. And yet, that’s
queer, too. I know no one who’s in desperate
need of my ideas and plans just now. Humph!
queer’s no word for it.”</p>

<p>As he said, he had already selected his crew
for the first flight of the <em>Winged Arrow</em>. The
men were volunteers, of course, and they had
signed off their personal indemnity before he accepted
them.</p>

<p>It was true, Ned Newton was to accompany
him. Ned was almost as able to pilot the boat as
Tom himself. Mr. Swift merely came down to
the lake to bid them good-bye and watch the flight
of the craft. He helped and advised Tom, but
he left the active work wholly in his son’s capable
hands now.</p>

<p>The crowd that gathered numbered several
hundred Shopton folk and probably some strangers.
But as the preparations for the test were
concluded Tom scrutinized the groups of spectators
sharply for a sight of the man who had previously
interested him.</p>

<p>Whether it was that individual who had got in
communication with Tom early that morning or
not, the young inventor did not see him in the
crowd.</p>

<p>“Did you see him?” he asked Ned Newton, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
the treasurer of the company came aboard at the
last moment.</p>

<p>“See who?” demanded Ned, in some surprise.</p>

<p>“The Frenchman, as you called him.”</p>

<p>“No, I had forgotten all about him.”</p>

<p>“I have an idea that he has not forgotten about
us—or about the <em>Winged Arrow</em>,” Tom said reflectively.</p>

<span class="fs80">IN PERIL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There was a deal of running about by the
crew, getting ready for the flight. Ned Newton
stared at his friend, the inventor, and asked
softly:</p>

<p>“Just what are you getting at, Tom? Do you
think that stranger is around again?”</p>

<p>“I am pretty sure of it,” said Tom, in the same
low tone. He swiftly related what he had heard
by radio-telephone that morning. “The thing is
mysterious, to say the least.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say so!” agreed Ned, wagging his head.
“I don’t see what it can mean.”</p>

<p>“We will hear more of it,” said Tom with confidence.
“But probably not to-day. At any rate,
no stranger goes on the <em>Winged Arrow</em> this first
trip.”</p>

<p>Although Rad Sampson had got breakfast for
his beloved young master in the galley of the seaplane
that morning, he got off in a hurry when
the time approached for the trial flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“I been up in de air befo’, big man,” he said
to Koku. “But, belieb me! I ain’t hankering
to go up no mo’ till Gabriel blows his trump.
No-suh!”</p>

<p>“Who Gab’el?” demanded the giant. “What
he blow for?”</p>

<p>“Ma goodness! Of all de ignerances I ever
heard tell of!” groaned Rad. “I don’t see how
you is ever gwine to git past Saint Peter, Koku.”</p>

<p>Koku merely blinked. He was worried about
Tom’s going up in the plane without him. But
nothing much else disturbed his simple mind just
then.</p>

<p>Tom tried out the motors several times. The
propellers worked perfectly. The hawsers holding
the plane to the dock were thrown off, and
then the big airship began to move. Tom headed
her out into the lake.</p>

<p>The crowd ashore cheered wildly as the nose
of the great seaplane rose from the surface. She
was then surrounded by a cloud of spray and her
motors were roaring. She lifted more and more,
and soon those ashore could see beneath the entire
length of the boat’s keel.</p>

<p>She hung above the water for a time, swerving
in a quarter circle so as to head inshore again.
Her wide wings and the two wheels underneath
for land travel made the machine look like some
huge winged insect or an antediluvian bird.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>The plane soared higher and higher, spiraling
upward over the heads of the interested spectators.
From the ground it seemed as though no
such huge machine could be floated in the air. It
must come crashing down to earth again!</p>

<p>But still it mounted. Mr. Barton Swift, with
binoculars at his eyes, watched the ascent with
keen interest and some apprehension. He saw
its wavering course, and realized that the balance
of the huge plane was not at all perfect.</p>

<p>Smaller and smaller grew the plane to the naked
eye. That it wabbled in its course meant little
to any of the spectators save the old inventor.
He knew that the crew of the <em>Winged Arrow</em> was
in trouble, if not in danger!</p>

<p>Suddenly the old gentleman was aware of the
presence beside him of a man who likewise followed
the course of the careening plane through
binoculars. Mr. Swift cast a sharp glance upon
this individual.</p>

<p>He was very well dressed in a spick and span
afternoon costume and wore a flower in his buttonhole.
His dab of black mustache and goatee
almost seemed painted upon his pale face. He
brought the glasses down from his eyes and looked
at Mr. Barton Swift.</p>

<p>“What do you say, sir?” he asked. “Is she not
making a heavy passage?”</p>

<p>Mr. Swift was instantly cautious. Tom had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
not spoken to his father about this mysterious
individual. But the old inventor had experienced
so much interference on his own part from rivals,
and had observed what Tom had sometimes suffered
as well, that he was not likely to divulge
his own private opinion to this stranger.</p>

<p>“You understand,” he said quietly, “that no
flying machine shoots into the sky like an arrow,
even if it is named <em>Arrow</em>.”</p>

<p>“True, true,” said the other eagerly. “It is a
good point, sir. But there! You see?” He
pointed again eagerly with his cane. “Did you
see her roll then?”</p>

<p>“An air-pocket, most likely,” Mr. Swift said
calmly.</p>

<p>But he knew that the <em>Winged Arrow</em> was not
yet high enough to find those atmospheric “holes”
which sometimes turn a plane over and often
cause wreck and disaster. Unlike the smaller
flying machines, the seaplane was not likely to
take a tail-spin and come down, unmanageable,
in that way. But she might buckle and break
her back in one of those aerial vacuums.</p>

<p>“Is it your opinion, Mr. Swift,” asked the
stranger in his too perfect English, “that this
plane will be a success?”</p>

<p>“My son evidently believes so, and that is
enough for me,” returned the old gentleman. “I
am no longer active in our business. I could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
give a professional opinion upon the matter at
this time.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You are cautious!” exclaimed the stranger.</p>

<p>“I am careful as to whom I talk with—yes,”
admitted Mr. Swift pointedly. “Come, sir! you
have as good eyesight as I have. Arrive at your
own judgments.”</p>

<p>He turned away from the stranger then and
gazed only at the rising plane. But even he had
small idea of what was going on aboard the
<em>Winged Arrow</em> at just this time.</p>

<p>Tom Swift and Ned Newton were in the bow
of the seaplane when she swam out of the cove.
The steering gear, as well as the tubes to the
mechanician’s compartment, were right at Tom’s
hand. Besides, the speed and altitude indicators
were here. Like every other plane, the <em>Winged
Arrow</em> was a “one-mind” machine. A single
individual must govern it all.</p>

<p>But, as Tom had long since pointed out, in
testing flying machines of all sizes, for safety’s
sake, there should be a second man in the cockpit
of even a monoplane. In handling this huge
plane it would be a reckless thing for only one
man to be at the steering and other gear. A second
must always be at hand to jump in and
take charge if anything happened to the chief
steersman, or pilot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>Therefore Tom had trained Ned Newton for
just this emergency. Ned had learned with the
inventor himself as the <em>Winged Arrow</em> was
building how to handle the gears which controlled
all the movements of the plane. He could start,
stop, raise, lower, and otherwise control the huge
machine about as well as Tom himself.</p>

<p>But on this maiden trip Tom allowed nobody
save himself to touch the mechanism in the bow
of the boat.</p>

<p>When the craft had gained speed enough on
the surface of the lake Tom lifted her nose cautiously
and, in a minute, sent her sliding skyward.
The slant of her nose became more abrupt
after a few minutes, and Tom shifted the levers
so that the flying boat aimed shoreward once
again.</p>

<p>At that time she was sailing not many yards
above the lake. As she came inshore the pilot
began to make her spiral upward. At first
her motion was merely a rocking one and not at
all unpleasant to the crew distributed about the
boat.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the plane rose at a sharper slant,
she began to roll. Ned shouted to ask his chum
what had happened, for the windows were open
on the sides of the prow and the drumming of
the wings and the rush of the air engendered a
noise that was almost deafening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” admitted Tom, shaking his
head. “Remember, this is my first trip in the
thing as well as yours. Why should <em>I</em> be supposed
to know all about it?” and he grinned
cheerfully as he looked at his chum.</p>

<p>But in a moment the car took another roll.
Ned thought it was about to turn turtle. It was
no laughing matter.</p>

<p>“Did you make her so she would fly just as
well upside down as on even keel?” he demanded,
having closed the windows.</p>

<p>Tom looked serious. His hand was on the
steering levers, or controls. He knew that this
rolling motion must wrench the framework of the
plane enormously. They heard the beams groan,
and somewhere a cable snapped.</p>

<p>“Listen to that, will you?” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>The plane kept on even keel for a few moments
longer. They had been in peril, as Tom well
knew. Were they now safe?</p>

<p>He lifted the nose of the craft a bit more and
again the wings dipped sideways and the boat
rolled “upon her beam ends,” as would have been
said of a seagoing craft.</p>

<p>“Stop her, Tom! Stop her!” shouted Ned,
scrambling up from the floor, where he had fallen
when the craft rolled.</p>

<p>But Tom knew that to shut off power and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
“stop” the flying boat would court greater disaster.</p>

<p>For some unknown reason the craft had lost her
balance, and when she rolled over the other way
it seemed to the young inventor as though she
must go completely over, her wings be wrenched
away, and the great craft fall to the earth in a
tremendous crash!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br>
<span class="fs80">A SECOND TEST</span></h2>
</div>

<p>After his second shout of alarm Ned Newton
remained quiet. After all, he did not lack either
physical or moral courage. He had not entered
into this test of the flying boat without knowing
very well that something might go wrong and
that a fatal disaster for all was possible.</p>

<p>How the mechanicians were affected, the inventor
and Ned did not know just then. The
members of the crew in the tail of the boat made
no comment through the speaking tube. As for
comments by anybody on the earth that might
be watching the careening plane, Tom Swift had
made no provision for receiving such a communication.
There was radio on board the <em>Winged
Arrow</em>, but it was not in use during this test.</p>

<p>Nor could any advice, even from Mr. Barton
Swift, have aided the young inventor in this serious
emergency. Something was wrong with the
balance of the seaplane. Just what it was, Tom
had not yet the first idea. He was as much puzzled
as anybody else could have been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>The rolling of the huge structure continued.
Had it not been put together with such care, the
plane would never have withstood the second roll.</p>

<p>Ned, who had gained his feet and who clung
to one of the hand-rails with which the compartment
in the nose of the boat was furnished, now
was silent. He watched his chum’s movements
with great anxiety, but he did not interfere by
either speech or act with Tom’s attempts to govern
the craft.</p>

<p>The inventor watched the needles of the several
indicators connected with the mechanism of
the plane. Some of these gyrated crazily when
the boat rolled. But there was an arrow on one
dial that stood still.</p>

<p>This dial had nothing to do with the driving
of the plane. At first it did not enter Tom Swift’s
mind that this dial—or what it registered—was
at all important to the flight of the seaplane.</p>

<p>It was the indicator which registered the
amount of compressed air that filled the “skin”
of the boat. This hollow between the outer and
inner hull of the craft had to do with the balance
and security of the plane when she had to
be brought down into the sea in rough weather.</p>

<p>Tom’s experiments with the pigs’ bladders and
the hollow bamboo had resulted in an attempt to
overcome boisterous waves through the weight of
compressed air between the two skins of the boat’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
hull. How it was going to work when the
<em>Winged Arrow</em> chanced to descend upon a rough
sea, was yet to be proved.</p>

<p>He noted the unwavering needle on this particular
indicator several times while the plane was
rolling without getting from it any inspiration at
all. Then, suddenly, he uttered a mighty shout,
grabbed for the flexible speaking tube, and yelled
to his chief mechanician:</p>

<p>“Brannigan! Start the pump! Get busy!”</p>

<p>“What pump, boss?” was the surprised query
from the tail of the boat.</p>

<p>“Compressed air! Isn’t but one, Brannigan!
Fill the skin!”</p>

<p>“All right, boss! Are you goin’ down?”</p>

<p>“Not if I can help it. I want to stay up,” answered
Tom, and dropped the tube.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea?” demanded Ned, staring at
him.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know what the idea is myself,
yet,” confessed the young inventor. “But something
has got to be done, and I am willing to try—Here
we go again!”</p>

<p>Once more the huge, groaning structure rolled.
If it looked bad to those on the ground, consider
how the crew of the <em>Winged Arrow</em> felt!</p>

<p>The usual kind of an equilibrator—that used
in the government of most dirigible balloons and
other flying craft—was a part of the <em>Winged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Arrow’s</em> equipment, but in this strange case the
instrument seemed to have no value at all. The
great hull of the seaplane certainly did not balance.</p>

<p>Whether Tom drove the mechanism fast or
slow, the rolling continued. No matter how
strongly the structure was built, such wrenching
must of necessity in time wreck the seaplane.</p>

<p>They were now a mile or more high in the air.
If the plane fell apart at this altitude there would
not be the smallest hope of escape for any of her
crew. Tom had tried to descend, but she seemed
to roll worse on a downward than on an upward
slant.</p>

<p>“Brannigan! Make use of that pump!” Tom
shouted through the tube.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” came back the reply.</p>

<p>The finger on the dial had begun to move.
The vacuum between the jackets of the hull began
to fill with air. The plane regained an even keel
again for a moment and Tom felt a tremor of
the hull which he knew to be from the pressure
of the air driven into the vacuum.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Tom?” demanded Ned,
putting his lips close to his friend’s ear.</p>

<p>“Trying a new one. Great Scott! Ned, if my
suspicion is right, I have worked a scheme for
balancing an object floating in air which as far
as I know is an entirely new trick. I have invented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
something—perhaps—without the first
idea that I was doing anything extraordinary.”</p>

<p>“Don’t care what it is,” replied Ned. “But if
it is what is stopping the boat from rolling——”</p>

<p>“I believe it is! It is a new equilibrator! I
believe it is going to work!”</p>

<p>“We’re sitting pretty now,” confessed Ned.
“Don’t try any more tricks till we are down
again.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fret.” Tom turned and spoke to Brannigan
through the tube again. “Shut off! All
right. Look out for yourselves back there. I
am going to zoom.”</p>

<p>The <em>Winged Arrow</em>, once more on even keel,
began to descend in a great spiral. Closer and
closer she came to the earth. There was Lake
Carlopa and the cove from which she had taken
to the air. After a time the two friends in the
bow of the plane could see the spectators on the
shore.</p>

<p>Tom Swift had quite recovered from his disturbance
of mind. He believed he had by chance
discovered something that really was of great
value in the management of this type of seaplane.
He wanted to talk it over with his father and
make other experiments before being sure that
he had guessed right.</p>

<p>After all, experiments in natural science are the
chief paths to invention. Tom thought that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
might have hit upon one of those lucky discoveries
that often aid in the establishment of worthwhile
knowledge.</p>

<p>When the seaplane finally took the water, the
air chamber had to be relieved of pressure before
the hull floated at a proper depth. Mr. Barton
Swift noted this at once and turned to see if the
well dressed and talkative stranger had taken
note of this fact.</p>

<p>The man had disappeared. A motor-car
shooting away along the road to Shopton suggested
the manner in which the stranger might
have gone. It was plain that for some reason
the man did not wish to meet the younger Swift
at this time.</p>

<p>Tom’s father was so much interested in his
son’s discovery regarding the compressed air
chamber and its value as an equilibrator that he
forgot to speak of the stranger and his evident
interest in the new flying boat.</p>

<p>Indeed, all those closely connected with Tom’s
experiments and with the success of the <em>Winged
Arrow</em>, thought of little else for the next few
days but the recurrent flights of the plane.</p>

<p>Tom took the jump-off from the surface of the
lake and from the ground. They made successful
landings on both the water and the earth.
After each flight there were adjustments to make
and changes in the mechanism. Tom and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
crew worked day and night upon the wonderful
flying boat.</p>

<p>At length Tom Swift was ready to make a
longer flight in the winged boat. Until he had
driven the <em>Winged Arrow</em> for a considerable distance
without descending and until he had made
a successful landing in rough water and a good
jump-off from the same, the young inventor
would not be satisfied that he had accomplished
what he had set out to do.</p>

<p>He and Ned had forgotten the stranger who
they believed had shown more than ordinary interest
in the success or failure of the flying boat.
And Mr. Swift had never mentioned that person
to his son.</p>

<p>Indeed, so deeply engaged was Tom Swift in
his new seaplane that other interests literally
faded out of his mind. Before the flight to the
ocean which he had determined on, however, Tom
spent an evening with Mary Nestor and her
mother.</p>

<p>At first Mrs. Nestor had heard so frequently
from the invalid on his northern trip that she
had lost much of her anxiety regarding Mr. Nestor’s
health and safety. But after the steamship
had landed him and Mr. Damon at Reykjavik
and Mr. Nestor had written one letter, his family
had not heard a word from him.</p>

<p>“They were going into the interior—to Rosestone—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
day following his letter,” Mary explained
to Tom. “What could have become of
them after that we cannot imagine. Mother is
becoming much worried again.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose that Iceland has postal
communication as frequently as we have it here
in the States, do you?” asked Tom. “It is sort
of a barren land, I understand. They are all
right. You’ll get a letter any day now.”</p>

<p>“It has been a month,” Mrs. Nestor declared,
shaking her head.</p>

<p>Tom laughed cheerfully. “No use talking. I
see I’ll have to provision this new plane of mine
and take a trip in her to Iceland to look up that
party.”</p>

<p>“You could not go so far in the <em>Winged Arrow</em>,
could you, Tom?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“I do not know why not. That is exactly what
I built her for—long trips. She is able to carry
provisions for a party of ten and enough gasoline
to last for at least a flight of two thousand miles.”</p>

<p>“Two thousand miles without coming down?”
cried Mary.</p>

<p>“About coming down, I don’t know. I expect
her to clear a hundred miles an hour when put to
it. Even if we don’t drive her more than fifty
miles an hour, we could make a journey two thousand
miles long in a little over a day and a half.</p>

<p>“And if she proves sea-worthy—if we can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
bring her down and launch her into the air again
from the surface of the ocean as easily as we
do from Lake Carlopa—I would not be afraid
of taking a trip to Iceland.”</p>

<p>“Well, I just guess you won’t!” cried Mary.
“That would be very perilous, Tom. Even if
father and Mr. Damon were in trouble up there,
you could scarcely help them by flying to them
in a seaplane.”</p>

<p>Tom laughed too. The idea was odd enough.
The use to which he expected to put the <em>Winged
Arrow</em> was entirely practical.</p>

<p>That next morning they made the trial trip
to the Atlantic. This test of the flying boat would
be a real test. If she had to be brought down,
either on land or sea, they would not be near headquarters
and the mechanicians aboard the plane
must be equal to all repairs that might be necessary.</p>

<span class="fs80">AMAZING NEWS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Tom Swift drove the <em>Winged Arrow</em> to a high
altitude when she left Lake Carlopa on her first
long voyage. It was a windy day, but pleasant.
The weather indications were favorable for the
journey, but the report from out at sea was that
a storm had shaken up the shipping a good deal.</p>

<p>“We have that matter of balance and safety
when taking to the water to settle, whatever else
we may do,” the inventor said to Ned Newton,
who was again his companion. “The hollow
sheath of the boat has proved a good thing while
we are in the air; but I should hate to learn that
I had planned something that turned out to be no
good for the object I had in mind, even if it was
useful in other ways.”</p>

<p>Besides the two chums aboard the flying boat
there were eight in the crew and a young man
named Kingston who was a wireless operator.
The <em>Winged Arrow</em> was supplied with the very
latest instruments for wireless and radiophone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
operation, and Kingston was well trained in his
business. He was, as well, a pleasant addition
to the plane’s company.</p>

<p>They flew so high that landmarks had to be
scrutinized through the glasses to make sure of
their nature. They passed over three states in
reaching the coast. From their height it seemed
as though the ocean were a hazy blue sheet of
glass with a white or yellow line marking the
shore. They scaled down nearer to it and saw
great ships tossing on mighty billows and the
surf viciously beating the sands of Cape Cod.</p>

<p>“Ho!” cried Ned. “I hope you are satisfied,
Tom. It looks just as safe to land down there
as though the ocean were a boiling cauldron.”</p>

<p>“It is exactly what we have come to experience,”
declared Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope everything is all right,” grumbled
his friend. “But I want to tell you right now
that I would rather be on dry land than on this
plane when she hits that sea. Whew!”</p>

<p>If Tom Swift felt any such fear he did not
express it. But his face was rather grim as he
scaled down the airways and brought the huge
flying boat hovering above the tossing waves. To
Brannigan, in the tail of the craft, he said:</p>

<p>“Test out your levers. See that everything is
buzzing right. We are going to subject her to
a severe test. All ready?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” rejoined Brannigan through
the tube. “Let her go!”</p>

<p>Kingston, whose little coop was directly behind
the pilot room, stuck his head out of his
door at that moment and shouted:</p>

<p>“Have a care about bumping His Majesty’s
liner, <em>Cantoria</em>. She’s right over yonder—you
can see her. I just picked up a ’gram from her
operator objecting to such big planes as ours being
tried out in the steamship lanes.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with that limey?” demanded
Ned. “Does he think he owns the whole ocean?”</p>

<p>“He is complaining to the U. S. Weather Bureau
about us, just the same,” declared the operator.</p>

<p>Tom shifted certain levers and the huge plane
dived for the riotous surface of the sea. She
swooped like a sea-eagle, skimmed the froth-capped
waves for some distance, and then settled
upon the water like a duck.</p>

<p>Foam and spray dashed completely over the
wings and the boat’s upperworks. They could
scarcely see through the side ports. The roar of
the waters pouring over the half buried craft was
deafening. For the next few minutes the <em>Winged
Arrow</em> was put through a test that surely would
have wrecked a less strongly built craft.</p>

<p>The compressed air between the skins of the
boat had to be increased considerably before she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
stopped rolling. The airtight pontoons at either
end of the wings were not sufficient stabilizers.
It seemed that Tom Swift’s ingenuity had actually
overcome a drawback that had baffled inventors
of similar planes.</p>

<p>The flying boat floated like a well ballasted
sailing craft. She climbed the steep waves,
pitched over their tops, and slid to the depths of
the trough between them with surprising ease.
When the waves broke against her wings, leaping
hungrily to overwhelm them, the perfect balance
of the hull brought the whole ship back to
an even keel in a few seconds.</p>

<p>Ned Newton was delighted. Aside from feeling
some little disturbance in his stomach because
of the boisterousness of the waves, he considered
the test a great success.</p>

<p>“If this was my flying boat I certainly would
slap myself on the back and give three cheers,”
he declared.</p>

<p>“You must be a remarkable contortionist to be
able to do that,” rejoined Tom, chuckling. “But
I really am not posing. It seems as though we
had hit the right idea. Hullo! What is the matter
with Kingston?”</p>

<p>Through the glass half of the door to the radio
coop they both saw that the operator seemed excited.
He had the eartabs clamped to his head
and was evidently listening in on something very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
important. With his right hand he wrote a few
words quickly and then wheeled and beckoned
Ned.</p>

<p>“Get this to the chief,” he said abruptly. “It
is relayed from Block Island. There may be more
of it.”</p>

<p>Ned wheeled about and thrust the paper into
Tom’s hand. The latter read the message at a
glance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“T. Swift, com. seaplane <em>Winged Arrow</em>, offshore,
N. Atlantic, relay: Return immediately
very important news of Damon and Nestor.—B.
Swift.”</p>
</div>

<p>Tom stared from the message to his friend.</p>

<p>“What do you know about that?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Don’t even know what it’s all about,” grumbled
the treasurer of the Swift Construction Company.</p>

<p>“Look at it!” ejaculated Tom, and handed Ned
the radio message.</p>

<p>“Great whales and little fishes!” gasped Ned,
when he had read it. “It is from your father!”</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be any joke, then,” considered Ned.
“Mr. Damon and Mary’s father must be in
trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>“But if they are up in Iceland and we are down
here, what can I do to help them out of trouble?”
cried Tom anxiously.</p>

<p>“That seems to be the question before the
house,” replied Ned. “Guess we’ll have to go
back home to find out. Your father is not very
explicit, that is certain.”</p>

<p>“He would not send this message at such a
time unless the matter was urgent. I am glad
we have been able to try out the <em>Winged Arrow</em>
as well as we have. Poor Mr. Nestor! Suppose
he has died up there? Or maybe Mr. Damon
is ill.”</p>

<p>“I hope not!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“If it is anything like that, somebody will have
to take passage at once for Iceland,” Tom went
on, in a worried way. “Mary and her mother
have nobody to look to for help but father and
me. Mary’s uncle is traveling around the world,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Then the duty devolves on you, does it?”
demanded the other young fellow. “And how
about business? What about the Swift Construction
Company? You will have to drop this
flying boat right where she is!”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” returned Tom, and he smiled
again, though rather ruefully. “If we dropped
her where she is, she would go to the bottom of
a very deep part of the Atlantic, Ned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t joke! This is too serious,” said his
chum.</p>

<p>“You are right. It must be serious—particularly
for the Nestors. If we have to delay the
exploitation of the <em>Winged Arrow</em>, all right.
The need of Mary and her mother comes
first.”</p>

<p>It might have been difficult to convince Ned
of this; but he made no further rejoinder. It
did seem too bad that, just as success seemed to
have crowned Tom Swift’s efforts in the building
of a wonderful flying boat, a chance like this
news from Iceland happened to postpone the final
speed and other trials of the new invention.</p>

<p>Tom did not waste time even in replying to
the wireless message. As they could not communicate
direct with the plant at Shopton he knew
that, barring accidents, the flying boat would
make her landing behind the Swift Construction
Company stockade before a radiogram could be
delivered to his father.</p>

<p>Out of the boisterous sea the great flying boat
rose like some huge waterfowl taking to the air.
Her compressed air compartments were gradually
emptied until she gained a perfect poise in the
air, some mile or more above the sea.</p>

<p>Tom guided her in a half circle and she headed
for the shore. The seaplane flew directly over
the British ship, <em>Cantoria</em>, the captain of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
had complained of the danger to ordinary shipping
by the nearness of the plane.</p>

<p>“This fact will undoubtedly make the commander
of that ship write to the <em>Times</em> when he
gets back to London,” chuckled Ned.</p>

<p>The seaplane rose higher as she neared the
shore. The yellow streak of Cape Cod was only
to be dimly distinguished through the lower windows
of the pilot room. Night had fallen when
the <em>Winged Arrow</em> spiraled over Shopton and
the works. Tom made a ground landing instead
of sinking to the surface of Lake Carlopa. He
was in a hurry to get home.</p>

<p>The searchlights in the yard of the shops
served as lighthouses for the plane’s landing. She
came down perfectly, bumping along the ground
easily upon the wheels, and finally stopped not
far from the highroad.</p>

<p>The Swift house was not far away. Aside
from Koku, who had been on watch continually
since the plane had flown away, there were few
people to greet the crew. Tom and Ned left the
mechanicians to attend to the flying boat and hurried
up to the house.</p>

<p>Mr. Barton Swift, very much disturbed for
him, was walking the library floor. He hurried
to greet Tom and Ned, waving a blue cablegram
in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“What is it, father?” Tom asked. “What has
happened to Mr. Damon and Mary’s father?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” confessed Barton Swift. “I
have been wondering and worrying all the afternoon.
And now I know less about it than I did
at first.”</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p>“It has crossed my mind that the message may
be a fake. It may come from some schemer who
wishes us ill. But on the face of it—here! Read
it!”</p>

<p>He thrust the cablegram into Tom’s hand.
The young inventor read, and read it aloud for
Ned Newton’s benefit:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mes. Damon and Nestor lost with treasure
chest on iceberg in Greenland Sea between Greenland
and Iceland. <em>Kalrye</em> a wreck and our boats
separated. Believe castaways alive on giant iceberg.
Cable funds for rescue, or advise—Olaf
Karofsen, com. <em>Kalrye</em>, Reykjavik.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br>
<span class="fs80">ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Ned declared the message was a fake. He
would not believe such an extraordinary tale could
be true.</p>

<p>“Somebody wants to get you off the <em>Winged
Arrow</em>,” he said. “That fellow who hung around
here at the launching—remember? The chap
with the Frenchy look. I bet he represented some
inventor who is trying to put out a machine like
yours. This is a scheme to take your mind off
your work and delay you.”</p>

<p>“It can’t delay me much now,” said Tom, puzzled.
“The flying boat has been proved practical—and
is practically complete.”</p>

<p>“I fear that something really terrible has happened
to our friends up there in the Arctic,” Mr.
Swift broke in.</p>

<p>“The chief thing to do is to find out about it,”
Tom said vigorously. “We’ll test this thing out—find
out who Captain Olaf Karofsen of the
<em>Kalrye</em> is.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to do that and him in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
Iceland?” scoffed Ned. “It will take you two
months or longer to get there.”</p>

<p>“We have got to look into it and try to find
Mr. Damon and Mary’s father, if it takes two
years,” declared Tom.</p>

<p>He set to work at once with telephone and telegraph
and got information from everybody he
could think of regarding Iceland and its chief
seaport. He reached a representative of Icelandic
commercial interests at his home in Boston and
was told how to cable in the most direct way to
Reykjavik. The Merchants’ Association there
verified Olaf Karofsen’s statement of the wreck
of his motor schooner in the ice and the loss of
several passengers and their possessions.</p>

<p>Before morning Tom had a pretty complete
story of the disaster. It seemed that because of
the lateness of the season no steamship would sail
from Reykjavik at once, and Mr. Damon had
engaged the motor schooner, <em>Kalrye</em>, to take his
party over to a Greenland port from which a
fishing steamer would sail south before winter
really set in.</p>

<p>In the night and fog the <em>Kalrye</em> smashed into
a shelf of ice just below the surface, which
seemed to be part of a gigantic iceberg, the peaks
of which stood up out of the sea several miles
distant. Mr. Damon was known to carry with
him a chest of treasure which he had come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
Iceland to secure. With this chest Mr. Damon
and his friend, with five sailors, had taken to one
of the <em>Kalrye’s</em> two boats. A heavy sea had
smashed it against the ice and the skipper and
his party had seen all in the wrecked boat get
onto the ice with their luggage.</p>

<p>Then the fog had shut down again and Captain
Karofsen had been unable to find the castaways.
He had returned to Reykjavik and was
now ready, if furnished with necessary funds, to
get up a searching party and start after the lost
men.</p>

<p>“It would be weeks before we could hear from
such a searching party,” groaned Mr. Swift.
“What will you tell Mary and her mother, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell ’em anything,” advised Ned. “Wait
until we hear something for sure.”</p>

<p>But this could not be. It was impossible to
hide the facts from Mary Nestor. Before Tom
had got out of bed, after spending most of the
night at the telephone, Rad knocked on his door.</p>

<p>“Miss Mary come, Mars’ Tom,” said the old
darkey through the keyhole. “She done got a
letter from her father.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Tom, getting out of
bed in a hurry. “He can’t have got off that iceberg
and written her, all as quickly as this!”</p>

<p>He did not stop to dress, but put on his blanket
robe and went downstairs. Mary was talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
with Mr. Swift and had already got an inkling
of the trouble. She was very pale and her
eyes glistened with tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom! what shall we do?” she cried, when
the young inventor appeared. “We never should
have let him go with Mr. Damon.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” Tom demanded. “Isn’t your
father better?”</p>

<p>“He says in this letter that he is. Much better.
But that was written a month ago. It was
sent by the last mail steamer for the season.
Father and Mr. Damon should have taken that
steamer. But the legacy Mr. Damon went after
had not then been put into his hands. Think,
Tom! Thirty thousand dollars in Danish money
that his old friend, Aman Dele, left to him. The
priest had it hidden away in a vault under his little
stone church at Rosestone. Father tells us all
about it in this letter.”</p>

<p>“Then they are only delayed up there in Iceland,”
began Tom rather faintly.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” exclaimed Mary. “I know more than
that. Your father says they have been wrecked
at sea. I must know all, Tom,” and Mary’s eyes
filled with tears as she struggled courageously
for self-control.</p>

<p>“Oh, it may not be anywhere near as bad as
it seems,” began Tom.</p>

<p>“But—but they <em>are</em> lost? Oh, Tom! What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
shall we do? And what would I ever do without
you, Tom? It startles me sometimes when
I realize how much I depend on you.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you do, Mary.”</p>

<p>“But what shall we do? It was so like Mr.
Damon to try to reach Greenland in a small boat!”</p>

<p>“Not so small, I imagine. That <em>Kalrye</em> carried
a crew of ten. A good-sized schooner. She probably
ran into a ledge of ice just as the <em>Titanic</em>
did, years ago. But the captain declares he saw
his men and passengers safely on the iceberg.”</p>

<p>“When was that?” Mary demanded, wiping her
eyes and speaking more practically.</p>

<p>“About ten days ago. The captain had to work
his way back to Reykjavik under sail in a whale
boat.”</p>

<p>“Could they live so long on an iceberg?”</p>

<p>“Why not if they had provisions? And the
captain said the other boat carried both water
and supplies.”</p>

<p>“But they would have to remain on the ice until
rescued!”</p>

<p>“Looks so,” admitted Tom.</p>

<p>“If we started at once for Iceland it would be
two months before we could get to Reykjavik,
wouldn’t it?” the girl asked.</p>

<p>Tom said nothing. His father exclaimed:</p>

<p>“My poor girl! Passenger service to the island
is probably closed until spring.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“Then,” said Mary Nestor firmly, “there is
only one hope for father.”</p>

<p>She looked straight at Tom, and he nodded
slowly.</p>

<p>“Only one chance that I can see,” he said.</p>

<p>It was the turn of Mr. Swift to be astonished.</p>

<p>“What do you two young people mean?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Tom smiled slowly. “Mary gets the idea, dad,”
he said cheerfully. “I shall start for Iceland just
as soon as possible. We will pick up Captain
Karofsen, if he will go with us, to point out the
iceberg where he left a part of his crew and the
passengers marooned, and——”</p>

<p>“But how will you go? What route will you
follow at this time of year?” Mr. Barton Swift
demanded.</p>

<p>“We’ll go on the wings of the wind,” declared
his son, laughing outright. “Of course, this eventuality
is exactly what I must have built the
<em>Winged Arrow</em> for. I will telephone the shops
at once and tell Brannigan to get the crew together.
I’ll take Ned and Koku. If my new
flying boat is any good at all, she ought to fly
to Iceland in less than three days. As soon as
she can be made ready, I will start, Mary.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom! suppose you should be lost, too?
Suppose you should be killed?”</p>

<p>“That can happen but once,” declared Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>“Only once! But that’s the horror of it!
Oh, Tom!” and Mary gave a slight shudder.</p>

<p>“Let’s not worry about that, Mary.”</p>

<p>But both knew that Mary would carry a load
of worry in her heart, and not entirely for her
father.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<span class="fs80">THE TRANSATLANTIC VOYAGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was possible, of course, to cable funds to
Captain Olaf Karofsen for the financing of a
searching party to go in quest of those marooned
on the giant iceberg. But Tom Swift knew that
the result of such a search could not be known
in the United States for weeks. He felt that he
could not restrain his desire to take an active
part in the search. Mary’s father and Mr. Wakefield
Damon must be found soon. And he believed
the best way to do this was to go personally
with the searching party.</p>

<p>Mr. Swift might have had some objections to
his son’s plan. He was getting old, and, although
his health now was much improved, he worried
whenever Tom left him for any extended trip.</p>

<p>In this case, however, he knew the young fellow
felt strongly that his duty lay in the only chance
of quickly assisting Mr. Nestor. The <em>Winged
Arrow</em> had proved her speed, her seaworthiness,
and her balance in the air. If she was good for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
anything at all, here was a set of circumstances
seemingly made by Fate for the trying-out of
the flying boat.</p>

<p>“Go if you must, my boy,” said the old gentleman,
with his hand on Tom’s shoulder when
he agreed to the arrangement. “But be very,
very careful.”</p>

<p>Although Tom was courageous, he was never
reckless. He had accepted Mary’s challenge on
the instant. But it was not without thought.</p>

<p>“The moment I read that cablegram from
Karofsen I saw what it meant,” he told Ned.
“The <em>Winged Arrow</em> can go where no vessel can
sail. If she arrives at Reykjavik in good condition,
she can sweep the whole of the Greenland
Sea, back and forth, until the berg on which the
men were cast away is found. If Karofsen is
honest——”</p>

<p>“That is a chance, too,” retorted Ned. “It
looks fishy to me, Tom.”</p>

<p>“What looks fishy?”</p>

<p>“His story. He knew all about that treasure
of more than a hundred and twenty thousand
Danish crowns. Humph! Suppose he and some
of his crew got up a scheme to grab the gold and
pitch those who were not in their confidence, as
well as the passengers, overboard? Looks fishy.”</p>

<p>“You sound mighty suspicious. And it might
be so. Anyway, how are we going to prove even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
such an awful thing if we can’t be on the
ground——”</p>

<p>“Huh! On the ice would sound better,” grumbled
Ned.</p>

<p>“All right. Whichever way you wish to put
it. Anyway, if we let the thing go on until next
spring any crime of the character you suggest
would be well covered up. I am going to get
there as soon as the wings of the wind will take
me.”</p>

<p>His decision, which he communicated to Captain
Olaf Karofsen by cable, must have amazed
that individual immensely. Tom cabled two hundred
dollars through a Danish-American bank
for the captain’s use until Tom himself arrived
in Reykjavik.</p>

<p>“Expect me on Friday,” was the concluding
sentence of Tom’s cablegram to the skipper of
the wrecked <em>Kalrye</em>. That day was three days
following the date of the cablegram. Later it
was proved that the message shook society in the
Icelandic port to its very foundations.</p>

<p>The fact that the new flying boat was about
to start upon a flight into the Arctic could not be
kept out of the newspapers, for the crew had to
be told where they were going if they stuck to
their jobs. And not one of the mechanicians refused
to take part in the expedition.</p>

<p>Besides, Koku was to go. Rad Sampson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
scoffed openly at this. He knew well enough that
he could not go himself. He must stay and take
care of Mr. Swift. But the old colored man refused
to acknowledge that Koku could be of any
possible use up near the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>“Mus’ be, Mars’ Tom, you is wantin’ to weight
down dat flying boat so she can’t eben rise out
o’ de sea. Dat big chunk of meat won’t be no
good to yo’ lessen yo’-all uses him fo’ an anchor.”</p>

<p>“Whuf!” snorted Koku. “Koku great man.
Koku fight!”</p>

<p>“See here, big boy,” returned Rad, “yo’ll have
a hot time fightin’ icebergs an’ polar bears.
Won’t be much else fo’ yo’ to fight—no, sir.”</p>

<p>However, the giant was proud indeed to be
one of the party booked for a transatlantic passage
heretofore never tried. The newspapers
made much of it. In the sheets issued the day
following the announcement of Tom’s determination
there were photographs of the crew of
the <em>Winged Arrow</em>, and prominent in the group
was Koku, dressed in the violently checked suit
that had been given him by the president of the
Hendrickton &amp; Pas Alos Railroad.</p>

<p>Beside Koku, who could actually be called a
member of the working crew of the <em>Winged
Arrow</em>, Ned Newton had announced his intention
of being of the party.</p>

<p>“If the inventor and head of the Swift Construction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
Company risks his life in such a venture,
the treasurer of the concern might as well
go along,” Ned declared. “If you are lost, Tom
Swift, there will be no company, so my job as
treasurer won’t be worth much. Count me
in.”</p>

<p>In like manner Kingston, the wireless operator,
asked for a berth in the cabin of the seaplane.
Tom really was touched by these expressions
of loyalty and good will.</p>

<p>“Mary is crazy to go, as well!” he said, with
a laugh. “But Mrs. Nestor vetoed the proposition
and saved me from doing so. Mary has
pluck enough to go.”</p>

<p>Two hours before the time set for the flying
boat’s departure the inventor was astonished by
still another application for passage on the
<em>Winged Arrow</em>. It was a request signed by Rear
Admiral Gilder, of the Naval Board, asking Tom
Swift to allow a representative of that Board to
accompany the party which the Admiral understood
was about starting for Iceland. A representative,
with full credentials from Washington,
was on the way to Shopton.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose this means?” Tom demanded
of Ned, who was his only confidant in
this event. “I have had no correspondence with
any Government official about the boat. I know
Rear Admiral Gilder by name, but——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“I bet you it is the French looking chap we
marked down!” cried Ned eagerly.</p>

<p>“You think he represented the Naval Board
and was spying about for them?” asked Tom,
with much doubt.</p>

<p>“Who else could he be?”</p>

<p>“He could be almost anybody else,” declared
Tom, shaking his head. “He was too foreign
looking to please me. And if he is the representative
the Admiral sends I shall not let him
aboard in any case.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the Government will buy the plane
at a big price,” suggested Ned, with some eagerness.</p>

<p>“Nobody will get a chance to buy it—not yet,”
Tom rejoined firmly. “And there is something
queer about this request, I tell you. It does not
look right. There is no time now to find out
about it. We shall be in the air, I hope, before
this representative, whoever he is, arrives at Shopton.
Not even the Naval Board can delay our
departure in this instance. Every hour is precious.”</p>

<p>Tom was not entirely correct in his expectation.
While the last preparations were being
made a powerful motor-car came into the open
lot behind the shops from which point the flying
boat was about to take its flight. The man who
got briskly out of the enclosed tonneau of the car<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
was exactly the individual both Tom and Ned
had in mind—the dressy individual with the
Charlie Chaplin mustache and diminutive goatee!</p>

<p>The man ran through the throng that had gathered
to watch the jump-off. He bore several
papers in his hands and he shouted to the boys
whom he saw in the windows of the prow of the
ship.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Swift! Monsieur Newton! Hi!”</p>

<p>“Hi yourself,” growled Ned. “There’s the
fellow, Tom.”</p>

<p>Tom gave the stranger a single glance and then
spoke to Koku:</p>

<p>“Stand by the open door, Koku. Let nobody
in over the gangplank but the crew. Understand?”</p>

<p>“Me understand, master,” said the giant, and
immediately stationed himself at the top of the
narrow gangplank near the stern which was about
to be drawn inboard.</p>

<p>When the stranger with the papers came to the
plank the giant waved him commandingly away.
The man started to argue. He might as well have
argued with a stone post. Koku could not understand
a word of English when he felt that way!
Nor did any other language sound right, although
the man tried French, German, and several other
tongues. Koku was deaf.</p>

<p>When the supposed representative of the Naval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
Board tried to advance up the plank, the giant
stooped, raised both plank and man, and shook
the latter off to the ground as though he had been
a beetle.</p>

<p>Then the last of the crew came aboard and
Koku drew in the plank and closed the door.
Every other arrangement had been made. The
propellers began to spin. The hawsers had been
cast off. The great flying boat began bumping
over the field.</p>

<p>They could not hear the foreign looking fellow’s
voice, but they saw that he ran after the
flying boat, screaming, for several hundred yards.
Then the <em>Winged Arrow</em> gathered speed enough
for her jump-off, and she rose heavily, slanting
upward at a good pitch, and wheeled away toward
the sea.</p>

<p>“If that fellow does represent a Government
Bureau, we’ll hear about it when we get back,”
said Ned, somewhat worried.</p>

<p>“Don’t bother your head about that,” rejoined
Tom. “There are more anxieties than that on
my mind.”</p>

<p>Tom had bidden good-bye to Mary Nestor and
her mother early that morning.</p>

<p>“Bring him back to me, Tom,” Mrs. Nestor
had murmured, through her tears.</p>

<p>“I know you will do your best, Tom, dear,”
whispered Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll do my best for you, Mary,” replied Tom
softly. And he lingered a little over his good-bye
to the girl, even though they both realized
the need for haste.</p>

<p>Had the young inventor needed any inspiration
for the journey, he would have gained it
from the thought that these two helpless women
were utterly dependent upon his good offices and
that they believed he would be able to find and
rescue the castaways on the giant iceberg.</p>

<p>The venture was one that was bound to bring
to the surface of Tom Swift’s character all his
better and braver qualities. He did not take this
trip in the big flying boat without fully understanding
what he was likely to be up against before
he returned home—if, indeed, he safely made
the return!</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours before, he had made up his
mind to take the journey. During that time he
had put every agency at his disposal at work to
the end that the party should be amply provisioned
and well secured against accident of every
kind.</p>

<p>Of course, fresh supplies of gasoline and oil
could be obtained at Reykjavik. Food, as well,
could be bought there. But the young inventor
did not leave Shopton and home without seeing
personally that every man with him was well
clothed, that in the cabin there were all the simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
medical remedies usually supplied to a sailing ship,
and that there were arms and ammunition for
every man.</p>

<p>Koku insisted on bringing his long spear and
a great war club. Ned wanted to forbid this
display of savage implements, but Tom allowed
his servant to bring the weapons in the use of
which he was versed.</p>

<p>“Those Icelanders will think we are American
aborigines instead of civilized beings,” grumbled
Ned.</p>

<p>“I reckon the polar bears will not criticize
Koku’s selection of weapons,” chuckled Tom.
“I’ve seen Koku catch a charging jaguar on the
point of that spear in mid-air and impale it as
you would stick a beetle with a pin. And one
crack with that war club would knock over a
walrus, I believe. Let him alone, Ned.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Ned. “You are quite sure, are
you, that we shall search the Greenland Sea for
Mr. Damon and Mr. Nestor? You thoroughly
believe Skipper Karofsen’s report?”</p>

<p>“Give him the benefit of the doubt,” said Tom
placidly. “You can scarcely judge a man’s character
by his cablegrams.”</p>

<p>Discussion was mostly barred, however, when
the <em>Winged Arrow</em> was well up and away from
her base. They followed a slightly different
course to the ocean line than they had on the trial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
trip. On the chart table Tom Swift had thumbtacked
a brand new map and had plotted out their
course from the vicinity of Shopton to the principal
seaport of Iceland.</p>

<p>The direction was almost exactly north of east.
It would take the flying boat over the great fishing
banks south of Newfoundland, across the
northern, or summer, route of the transatlantic
steamships, and over the lonely reaches of that
great northern ocean on which at this season of
the year drifted countless icebergs.</p>

<p>Ned studied the course as closely as Tom had
previously done. “If Mr. Damon and Mr. Nestor
started for Greenland to catch a steamer, how is
it Karofsen reports that they were wrecked in the
Greenland Sea?” he asked. “That is north of
Iceland. The most direct route to the Greenland
coast from Reykjavik is across Denmark Strait.”</p>

<p>“I guess the only town from which fish is
shipped south is on what they call the Liverpool
Coast,” his friend replied. “You will see that
that section of Greenland is across Greenland Sea.
If the current sets toward the south, however,”
Tom added, “this gigantic iceberg that Karofsen
tells about may be drifting into Denmark Strait.
That being the case, it may possibly narrow our
search.”</p>

<p>Ned merely grunted in rejoinder. Even if they
reached Iceland safely in the flying boat, he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
grave doubts as to their ever finding a “chunk
of ice,” as he expressed it, floating around in the
Arctic seas with seven men upon it and a treasure
chest containing more than a hundred and
twenty thousand Danish crowns!</p>

<p>When the flying boat crossed the line of the
seacoast and flew out over the Atlantic it was
plain that the sea had gone down. When they
were well out from the shore the surface of the
water seemed as smooth as a mill pond.</p>

<p>But, smooth or rough, Tom hoped that he
would not be obliged to descend in the seaplane
until the <em>Winged Arrow</em> arrived at her destination.
He had taken every precaution, he believed,
for the long and arduous flight. The speed at
which they traveled encouraged him to believe
that his hope would be realized.</p>

<p>As they went on, flying so high that shipping
on the sea could only be distinguished through
the glass, the atmosphere became very cold.
They were getting farther away from the source
of earth heat and the thermometer fastened outside
one of the windows of the pilot room showed
a rapid decline of the fluid.</p>

<p>Every man aboard the great flying boat had
been dressed in warm clothing—the batten-lined
leather suits of the ordinary flying men—when
they left the ground. But Tom had furnished
fur coats and hoods and gloves for them all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
Their boots were sheepskin lined. Water began
to freeze inside the boat; but the crew kept
warm.</p>

<p>Their breath began to congeal upon the inside
of the windows and Ned spent most of his time
cleaning the glass with alcohol. Kingston at first
had sent news of the flight by wireless; but now
the altitude and the temperature interfered with
the working of the radio. Static made the sending
and receiving of messages all but impossible.</p>

<p>The member of the crew who acted as cook
brought coffee and sandwiches into the cabin and
reported that the electric heaters did not work
as well as previously and that it was difficult to
boil water.</p>

<p>“We are up pretty high,” Tom admitted; “but
I believe if I scale her down much we shall be
buffeted a good deal by head winds. We are making
excellent time as she is. If we can stand the
cold until nightfall——”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” replied Ned. “I might as well be
a frozen turnip as the way I am,” he grumbled.
“Do you see Iceland yet?”</p>

<p>“I’ll wake you up when I see Olaf Karofsen
smoking his pipe on the dock at Reykjavik,”
scoffed Tom.</p>

<p>It was cold! And the idea of waiting until
nightfall before dropping to a lower altitude was
found not to be feasible. In the first place, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
had flown into the region of long twilight. Darkness
did not come until near midnight.</p>

<p>The <em>Winged Arrow</em> had by that time flown
more than a thousand miles. Her inventor did
not push her to her top-notch speed, but the time
she made was perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<p>Crew and officers of the flying boat stood
watch and watch, as on shipboard. Tom could
not be at the controls all of the time, and he slept
at least two full four-hour watches during the
flight. But he was in charge when, late the following
day, a hazy spot on the sea ahead announced
the presence of land.</p>

<p>The perfectly adjusted instruments with which
the pilot room in the prow of the flying boat was
supplied had enabled them to keep on almost a
direct course for Iceland. There could be no mistake
in this. As she drew nearer and Tom pitched
her nose on a downward slant, they saw the white
horses of the surf breaking against the rockbound
shore of the great island.</p>

<p>They spied a cluster of houses and several
church spires on the southwestern coast, and
steered for that point.</p>

<p>“Reykjavik,” declared Tom Swift.</p>

<p>“I thought that must be on the north side of
the island if that wrecked schooner started across
Greenland Sea,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“They passed along the western and northern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
coast of the island before pushing out for Liverpool
Coast,” announced his friend. “At any rate,
that schooner captain must be a pilot for these
seas, and knows his business. The thing that
troubles me is, will he go with us in the <em>Winged
Arrow</em>? He may be afraid.”</p>

<p>“We’ll kidnap him, then, and make him go,”
declared Ned warmly. “We haven’t come all this
way to be balked like that, I should hope!”</p>

<span class="fs80">“SOMETHING ROTTEN IN DENMARK”</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The <em>Winged Arrow</em> spiraled above the Icelandic
port until she was so close to the ground
that all landmarks could be easily distinguished.
There were open fields behind the town, and Tom
marked one of these cleared spaces for his landing.</p>

<p>They saw a good part of the inhabitants of
Reykjavik trooping out of the town toward the
place where it was evident the huge flying boat
would make her landing. Tom and his crew
were so much engaged in the work of bringing
down the plane that at first the nature of the
throng hurrying out from the town did not impress
itself upon their attention.</p>

<p>The <em>Winged Arrow</em> swooped and rebounded
from her wheels. The truck groaned and the tail
of the boat began to drag. Her speed was soon
brought down, she halted, Koku slid back the
main door in the hull of the boat and was about
to thrust out the narrow gangplank.</p>

<p>But Ned had spied something that the others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
had not at first noted. Marching in the van of
the crowd from town were about two dozen uniformed
men bearing rifles on their shoulders.</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” said Ned, pointing out this military
party, “the Iceland militia may want to interfere
with our landing, Tom. What say?”</p>

<p>“A warm reception, is it?” asked Kingston,
sticking his head out of the radio coop.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Tom, beckoning to Koku.
“Don’t let anybody get aboard yet, boy.”</p>

<p>Koku dropped the end of the gangplank and
in a couple of strides reached his long spear and
war club. When he appeared at the open door
again his appearance was, to say the least, rather
warlike.</p>

<p>The military, or policemen, or whatever they
were, warned the boys back, and most of the men
and women remained at a safe distance from
the flying boat. But one excited individual, who
seemed to have some influence with the squad
of soldiers, pushed up close to the seaplane and
began to shout.</p>

<p>“If the only language they use here is the kind
that old friend of Mr. Damon’s tried to use in
New York,” said Ned, who had heard about
Aman Dele’s troubles, “we’ll have a sweet time
learning what they want or making them understand
what we want.”</p>

<p>“Of course many folks on the island understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
English,” declared Tom, and went to the open
door which Koku so savagely guarded.</p>

<p>“This is the flying boat from America—yes?”
asked the excited man in broken English.</p>

<p>“Were you expecting two?” asked Tom, chuckling.
“I guess this is she.”</p>

<p>“I represent the Soviet Government,” was the
man’s next astonishing declaration. “By cablegram
I was told to expect this flying wonder.
You and your crew, Captain, may land. I take
charge of the flying boat from now on. It is
arranged to send her on to Russia with our own
men.”</p>

<p>“To Russia?” gasped Tom Swift. “You represent
the Bolshevist Government of Russia?”</p>

<p>“The Soviet Government—yes. The Governor
of Reykjavik has agreed to allow the exchange
to be made here——”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” broke in the young inventor.
“Either you are out of your mind, or somebody
has been fooling you. I built this flying boat
myself and I have no intention of selling it to
Russia or any other country.”</p>

<p>“What is that? You deny that our representative,
Monsieur Polansky, bought this flying boat
and cabled me to take it over when it landed
here?”</p>

<p>“You are crazy!” exclaimed Tom Swift, in disgust.
He beckoned to the uniformed officer in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
command of the military force. “Do you speak
English?” he cried.</p>

<p>“But yes, Monsieur. Speak slowly. I can
understand you,” said the officer.</p>

<p>“Then understand me right now,” Tom said,
with emphasis. “This fellow who says he represents
Russia, has absolutely nothing to do with
this flying boat.”</p>

<p>“No? But he has writings from the Governor——”</p>

<p>“I am here,” interrupted Tom, in firm tones,
“to search for two friends—Mr. Damon and Mr.
Nestor—who were lost from the wreck of the
motor schooner <em>Kalrye</em>. Do you understand me?
Where is Captain Olaf Karofsen?”</p>

<p>“I do not understand!” cried the officer anxiously.
“I am instructed to take charge of this
machine until the Russian official brings his crew
to sail her away.”</p>

<p>“You will not take charge of my flying boat,
and no bunch of Russian Reds will ever get hold
of it!” declared Tom warmly. “I begin to smell
the rat in this meal bin,” he added over his shoulder
to Ned.</p>

<p>“What is it? Oh! That Frenchy who was so
anxious to come with us?”</p>

<p>“Bet you a copper cent!” ejaculated Tom.
“But he was no Frenchman. A Russian!” Then
to the disturbed officer of the Danish squad he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
said: “Better send this Soviet Consul, or whatever
he is, home with a flea in his ear. We are
on an important mission, and if we are interfered
with I will send for Mr. Shantuck, the representative
of the United States. You know him?”</p>

<p>“Quite so, Monsieur,” said the officer, who evidently
understood French better than he did English,
and of which language Tom Swift could
speak a few words. “But this gentleman——”</p>

<p>“He has absolutely nothing to do with my flying
boat,” declared the young inventor. “See!
Who is that coming?”</p>

<p>He had caught sight of a figure almost as tall
as Koku’s pushing its way through the crowd of
interested spectators. Tom had noticed that there
were many tall men in the throng, but this person
was head and shoulders above most of them. He
was heavily bearded and wore a knitted jersey
and cap, as some foreign sailors do.</p>

<p>“This may be your Captain Karofsen,” said
the military officer.</p>

<p>The burly giant who approached swiftly impressed
Tom on nearer view most favorably.
While the self-styled representative of the Soviet
Government sputtered to the military officer, the
big sailor came close to the side of the seaplane.</p>

<p>“Misder Swift—yes?” he said in a deep voice.
“When I got telegram you come in t’ree days I
say: ‘Das American come t’roo de air—yes?’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
Undt, py jolly! so he came—yes. I sail to America
once, twice. So I spe’k de English goot.”</p>

<p>“You surely do, Captain,” declared Tom delightedly,
realizing that this man was too simple
a soul to have entered into any plot against Mr.
Damon and Mr. Nestor. “But it looks as if we
might have trouble if we stop here for long.”</p>

<p>“Vot trouble iss dot?” demanded Captain
Karofsen.</p>

<p>Tom explained briefly about the claim made by
the Red who still gabbled angrily to the military
officer. He was threatening to call upon the Governor
of Reykjavik to reiterate an order to seize
the seaplane.</p>

<p>“And we must get some more gasoline before
we try to find that iceberg,” concluded Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes—I see,” agreed Captain Karofsen. “You
go find Misder Damon undt the sick man with
this flying boat? I been trying to charter one
sailing boat—yes.”</p>

<p>“What do you think? You’ll go with us, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Jes. She peat all de sailing poats in de vorl’,”
cried the captain emphatically. “I see her sail
down out of the skies, so like von bird. Wonderful!”</p>

<p>“But the gasoline?”</p>

<p>“Gasoline we shall buy at a station on the north
coast of Iceland. A Standard Oil tanker bane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
stop dere twice in de year now—yes. You pay
me for my time, Misder Swift?”</p>

<p>“I surely will. You will lose nothing by going
to help us,” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“I go. I gif you back de eight hunder’ gold
crowns you send me undt you pay me my captain’s
wages like I have before de <em>Kalrye</em> she was
sink. Eh?”</p>

<p>“A bargain!” declared Tom. “When do we
go?”</p>

<p>“Let dat big man give me de hand up, and we
start now,” answered Skipper Karofsen placidly.
“When dat man down dere want to make trouble
we will not be here. Ja—yes?”</p>

<p>The coolness of this proposition delighted Ned
immensely; and Tom was satisfied that it would
be the best and wisest way out of the difficulty.
He did not intend to be delayed here if he could
help it.</p>

<p>“Guess we’d better take his tip and go,” Tom
remarked with a questioning look at Ned.</p>

<p>“As Shakespeare once wrote, ‘there is something
rotten in Denmark,’” rejoined Ned, in a
low voice, peering out at the excited Bolshevist.
“If the Island authorities wish to call us to account
for what we do, we’d better hunt for the
castaways first. Come aboard, Captain Karofsen.”</p>

<p>Tom motioned to Koku, who dropped his spear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
and club and stooped to seize the other giant’s
wrist. Koku lifted and Captain Karofsen heaved
himself up with surprising agility. Without
using the gangplank he reached the sill.</p>

<p>“Mark the place we shall stop for gasoline on
that chart, Captain,” said Tom, pointing to the
chart table.</p>

<p>The next moment he signaled Brannigan to
start the motors. The flying boat began to quiver
throughout her length. They were about to make
the jump-off.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<span class="fs80">THE GIANT BERG</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The first movement of the big flying boat attracted
the attention of the crowd of onlookers
as well as the soldiery and the excited civilian
that had put in such a ridiculous claim for possession
of Tom Swift’s newest invention. Those
gathered in the pilot room of the seaplane could
see everyone hurrying to get out of the expected
course of the <em>Winged Arrow</em>.</p>

<p>“We’ll settle that fellow’s hash when we come
back,” declared Tom, shaking his head, as he
glanced out at the stranger.</p>

<p>“<em>If</em> we come back, you mean,” replied Ned.
“And take it from me, Tom, that chap is linked
up with the French fellow that bothered us before
we left Shopton.”</p>

<p>“Looks so. But that Polansky, as this chap
called him, was no Frenchman, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t matter. He had an awful amount of
nerve,” said Ned. “Now we’re rising!”</p>

<p>The seaplane took the air as nicely as she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
before. Captain Olaf Karofsen was tracing the
course they should follow across Iceland. The
place to which he directed Tom for gasoline was
a small whaling port facing the stretch of Arctic
Ocean called the Greenland Sea.</p>

<p>The long twilight of this northern clime made
the journey really a pleasant one. Tom, to avoid
air currents caused by the mountains, veered a
little and skirted a shoulder of Mount Hekla,
from the crater of which a thin column of smoke
was rising. The captain told them there had been
no eruption of the ancient volcano since he was
a child, but it was not entirely cold.</p>

<p>Captain Karofsen was much more interested in
the management of the seaplane, however, than
he was in the physical wonders of Iceland. The
boys were eager to know the particulars of the
wreck of the <em>Kalrye</em> and how Mr. Damon and
Mr. Nestor had been thrown upon the iceberg.</p>

<p>“I lost das schooner—yes,” said the captain,
shaking his head. “Das insurance don’t pay me
for all. And if them gentlemen are lost for good,
I never get over it.”</p>

<p>It seemed that in the night and fog two monstrous
peaks of ice loomed up ahead of the
<em>Kalrye</em>, but so many miles away that the captain
and crew of the schooner had no idea their boat
would collide with the berg.</p>

<p>She had run bow on to a ledge, and with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
heavy sea following her, the stiff hull of the
schooner was battered into wreckage in a very
few minutes. The two boats were got safely out
and the crew divided. Both boats were well provisioned.
The one in which the two passengers
sailed with their treasure and baggage was badly
managed. A billow caught up the craft and threw
her broadside upon the ice.</p>

<p>“She vas smashed like you step on von cockroach,”
groaned Karofsen. “But dark as it vos,
I see all the party high and dry. They signal us
with flashlight. We tell them we go for help—yes.
It was the best we could do.”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” agreed Tom. “And if you are
sure you can pick out the same berg——”</p>

<p>“Jes! It vos so pig a perg—yes. I could not
be mistaken. And those great spires of ice, side
by side! Fear not, Misder Swift, I bane sure
of it.”</p>

<p>“Do you feel quite sure that they are still
alive, Captain?” Tom asked.</p>

<p>“They haf food—yes. They may freeze, but
they do not starve. And if they haf sense they
save wreckage from the boat to make fire. Ja!”</p>

<p>“At any rate,” Tom said more cheerfully to his
chum, “it’s a chance.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose so. But you yourself look
out how you go sailing around over these icebergs.
If you break a wing or a propeller or anything,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
and we drop on to a field of ice ourselves, we’ll
be as bad off as Mr. Damon and Mr. Nestor.”</p>

<p>From the height at which the seaplane sailed
across the island, heading north now, the travelers
could see a vast expanse of the Arctic sea.
The sun was so low on the horizon that its beams
gave little light. But the sky seemed overcast
with a luminous haze and under that the sea, and
what floated upon it, was clearly visible.</p>

<p>Countless little crackling points of dull fire revealed
the presence of broken ice. Here and
there a spire, or hummock, rose to a considerable
height from the surface. Tom Swift and his
friends began to realize for the first time just what
a search for a particular iceberg in these cold
regions might mean.</p>

<p>They were utterly dependent on Captain Olaf
Karofsen, it seemed. If he failed to remember
how the berg looked on which he had last seen the
marooned party of sailors and passengers, it
would be very difficult for the searchers to find
them.</p>

<p>“Looking for a needle in a haystack wouldn’t
be in it!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>Captain Karofsen took Tom’s glasses and
peered steadily at the shore line ahead. He spied
out at last the little collection of houses he had in
mind, and Tom slightly changed the course of
the seaplane to more nearly hit the port.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>There was a breakwater and fishing boats; and
at one point a tall staff which they soon made out
to be rigged with wireless antennæ. Late as it
was in the evening (nearly midnight now) they
saw the inhabitants of the fishing port moving
about. As the flying boat dropped lower, it
was plain that there was some excitement below.</p>

<p>The great gasoline tanks were built on an iron
bridge over the water and inside the breakwater.
Captain Karofsen said there was plenty of hose
with which the tank of the seaplane could be connected
with the supply tank. There was an open
field on the edge of the water where the flying
boat might be brought down in safety.</p>

<p>But the sight of that wireless outfit had made
Tom a little suspicious. Instead of sweeping
down at once to the land, he shot the great boat
out to sea, and then headed back again, facing the
gas tanks. The pool of water inside the breakwater
was fairly smooth.</p>

<p>“I see some more of those armed and uniformed
men there,” he said to Captain Karofsen.
“We left Reykjavik without permission of the
authorities. If your governor is one of those
pompous fellows, he like enough has wirelessed an
order over here to arrest us if we come down
for gasoline.”</p>

<p>“He could do dot,” agreed the schooner captain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
wagging his shaggy head like a nodding
mandarin.</p>

<p>“I am going to drop inside the breakwater,”
Tom said quickly. “I can see there is room there.
And we can make our jump-off all right after filling
the tank. Ned, pass the guns to the crew;
but no ammunition. We may have to make a
show of force, but of course there must be no
shooting.”</p>

<p>“Master, let Koku go ashore,” cried the giant.
“Him dribe um off with his spear.”</p>

<p>Captain Karofsen seemed much impressed by
the savageness of Koku.</p>

<p>“I pet you him undt me could clean oudt the
whole town. But Misder Swift, you no be
troubled. Them polize don’t fight yet unless the
governor make ’em. They for what you call
show—yes?”</p>

<p>“That is all right,” laughed Tom. “But I, for
one, have a hearty respect for the police of any
country. Let’s get this gasoline without any
fight, if we can.”</p>

<p>With the drumming of the motors stopped, the
flying boat sank to the surface of the water almost
in silence. By a patent arrangement, almost as
soon as the plane was on even keel one of the airtight
pontoons which were affixed to either end
of the wings was detached and drawn in to an
open door in the hull of the great craft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>This small boat was driven by a detachable motor.
There was room in the cockpit for Tom
and Koku and Captain Karofsen, but it was a
tight fit! They pushed off immediately for the
beach under the gasoline tanks.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the port were gathered in a
wondering group just above high water mark.
They were mostly fishermen and their wives and
children. There were six of the uniformed police,
and their spokesman immediately advanced with
a blue paper in his hand.</p>

<p>He spoke in a language which Tom did not
understand, but which Captain Karofsen was familiar
with. The schooner captain answered
angrily. Then he said to Tom:</p>

<p>“This big walrus make de same demandt—yes.
They are all crazy yet. I bane have a goot mind
to slap him. He says we steal the seaplane.”</p>

<p>“What does he want to have us do with it?”
asked the inventor.</p>

<p>“Pring it ashore,” and Karofsen laughed.</p>

<p>“Tell him we have to have gasoline before we
can move it at all. Get the gasoline. That is the
first thing to do.”</p>

<p>Captain Karofsen, much amused, proceeded to
convince the people ashore that the seaplane was
immovable without a supply of gasoline. Tom
had money with which to pay for what he needed,
and after about half an hour’s wrangling the hose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
was connected to the <em>Winged Arrow’s</em> tank and
a good supply of gasoline pumped aboard.</p>

<p>The small boat was then withdrawn from the
beach and Tom and the two giants got into the
hull of the plane. The airtight boat was coupled
to the end of the wing again and they prepared
for flight.</p>

<p>If the police of the fishing port expected to see
the huge machine jump over the oil tanks and
land on the beach, they were mistaken. When
she took to the air, Tom swerved her in a half
circle and she shot out over the sea again and
soared into the darkening sky at railroad speed!</p>

<p>A sprinkle of brilliant stars had now appeared.
The dome of the sky was like a deep blue velvet
robe, all trimmed with sparkling sequins. On the
horizon flashes of purple, scarlet, and green denoted
the distant Aurora Borealis. It was a perfect
Arctic night.</p>

<p>Tom sailed his flying boat not far above the
water and ice. Vast sheets of the latter gleamed
below the flying boat and they could trace long
canals between the fields. Here and there rose
the peak of a great berg.</p>

<p>“When you consider that only about one-seventh
of the bulk of a berg is above the surface
of the water, some of those fellows must
be extraordinary in size,” Tom said to Ned and
Kingston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>“Some icebergs, I’ll say!” murmured the wireless
operator. “And there are thousands of them.
How are you ever going to pick up the one those
folks were wrecked on?”</p>

<p>But Tom had already thought seriously of that
point. The chart and Captain Karofsen agreed
that the set of the current was southward between
Greenland and Iceland, through the wide Denmark
Strait.</p>

<p>“In all probability that berg our friends are
on has been carried into the strait by this time,”
Tom declared.</p>

<p>“You seem dreadfully certain that the poor
chaps are still alive,” Ned said.</p>

<p>“Captain Karofsen has hope of that, so why
not?” rejoined Tom. “We have not come away
over here to find Mr. Damon and Mary’s father
starved or frozen, I hope.”</p>

<p>But Tom was anxious. He would not leave
his post in the pilot room that night. As the
darkness increased the two great searchlights of
the seaplane flashed their beams over the icefields,
and it did seem as though, if there were
any castaways there, these signals would be answered.
The castaways from the <em>Kalrye</em> were
known to have electric torches.</p>

<p>Until the thin edge of the sun appeared above
the horizon again the <em>Winged Arrow</em> soared over
the sea. Captain Karofsen pointed out the coast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
of Greenland, which the boys at first had thought
was a row of icebergs in the distance.</p>

<p>“My <em>Kalrye</em>, she vos sailing by there when she
vos wrecked,” said the schooner captain. “We
make it in about two days more. Undt she iss
lost!”</p>

<p>The plane swept around and drifted back toward
Iceland on the other tack. Beneath, the
points of broken ice began to sparkle, tipped by
the brief rays of the sun. The sheets of unbroken
ice were as blue as the sea itself. As the plane
moved southward there were fewer open channels
and pools. It seemed, before noon, as though
able men cast away in this ice might make their
way to one shore or the other.</p>

<p>Yet, if they did, neither the Greenland nor Iceland
coasts afforded much hope of succor. The
first named was utterly barren for hundreds of
miles, while the fishing settlements on Iceland
were far apart on this northwestern coast.</p>

<p>Now and again somebody spied something moving
on the ice, and down the flying boat would
swoop that the object might be the better examined.
In each case the searchers were disappointed.
Several times small herds of seals were
made out, or a pair of walruses. Once a huge
polar bear was seen drifting down a channel, enthroned
on a lump of ice. It had evidently been
fishing at the edge of the open water and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
chunk of ice had broken away from the parent
field.</p>

<p>A school of round-backed whales, some ten of
them, were observed swimming down a channel,
evidently making for the warmer seas.</p>

<p>“Let Mr. Damon and his party catch one of
those whales or a bear, and they’ll be fixed all
right for food,” said Ned, chuckling. “Wouldn’t
Mr. Damon be blessing everything in nature if
he came to eating blubber?”</p>

<p>Tom drove his flying boat first to the east until
they could see the coast of the big island they had
left the night before, and then turned her about
and drove west until Greenland was in sight. At
each lap he brought their course many miles southward.
Little floating on the surface of the sea
escaped their keen gaze.</p>

<p>It was mid-afternoon when Captain Olaf Karofsen,
looking through Tom’s powerful glasses,
began to show more excitement. Even with only
the naked eye there could be seen ahead two tall
pinnacles like cathedral towers. There was a
narrow space between them, and miles upon miles
of hummock ice and low bluffs lay about the two
spires.</p>

<p>“Dot iss she!” exclaimed Captain Karofsen.
“I vould not fool you, Misder Swift. Dot is de
perg I see Mr. Damon and the sick man undt my
five sailors from the <em>Kalrye</em> climb upon when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
their boat was smashed. I could not mistake
those two points like chimneys.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything moving on that great field
of ice?” demanded Tom anxiously.</p>

<p>His companions used their eyes, and the binoculars,
as well, to the best advantage. Tom drove
the flying boat nearer and nearer to the pinnacles
of ice. Not a moving object was descried beneath
them. The great iceberg seemed to be as
abandoned as any of the other fields they had
flown over during their marvelous journey
through the air.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br>
<span class="fs80">THE DESERT OF ICE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The portion of the great iceberg that was visible
consisted of a good many square miles of hills
and valleys of ice, with the two more important
eminences standing close together near the middle
of the vast field.</p>

<p>It was so huge that its movement (and bergs
are always in motion) could not be observed at
all. It seemed as immovable as the island of
Iceland itself, yet Captain Olaf Karofsen was
positive that it had drifted a good many miles
southward during the two weeks since his
schooner had been wrecked on one of the outer
reefs of the berg.</p>

<p>As the <em>Winged Arrow</em> swooped lower, and
Tom Swift drove it around the entire outer edge
of the iceberg, the schooner captain tried to mark
the spot where the <em>Kalrye</em> had struck and sunk
and the spot where the lifeboat had been smashed.</p>

<p>There was not a scrap of either wreck to be
seen. The changing surface of the ice offered no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
certain mark of any party of castaways having
been upon it. The seaplane circumnavigated the
huge berg twice with the same result. The hearts
of Tom and Ned failed them. They feared that
the disaster had been wholly tragic, after all.</p>

<p>But Captain Karofsen would not give up hope.
He pointed out that his five sailors were all seasoned
men, used to the Arctic, and of wide experience.
First of all, he said, they would have
saved the boat, cut it up with the boat axes, and
transported it and the provisions to some sheltered
place on the berg.</p>

<p>“There be hunderts of caves—yes? Many,
many places for to hide and keep varm. Iceland
men don’t gif up so easy, Misder Swift.”</p>

<p>It was plain to be seen that there were many
valleys and sheltered dens in the middle of the
berg into which the crew of the seaplane could
not see. The flying boat might pass back and
forth over the iceberg a hundred times and not
be spied by the castaways if they were thus holed
up.</p>

<p>“But we do not even see any smoke,” said
Ned. “If they had a fire——”</p>

<p>“They would be careful with their fuel,” interrupted
Tom. “We might hang around up here
for a couple of days and miss seeing anything of
them if they are there——”</p>

<p>“A wise ‘if,’” interrupted Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“Unless they come out to hunt food——”</p>

<p>“Hoh!” cried Ned again. “Dig potatoes, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be foolish!” commanded Tom. “There
are seals and bears, and Captain Karofsen says
that both Mr. Damon and Mr. Nestor had rifles.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ned. “I did not think
of that.”</p>

<p>“So,” concluded Tom firmly, “I am going to
descend into that middle valley——”</p>

<p>“Not between those two peaks, Tom?” cried
his friend. “That is a bad hole to get out of.”</p>

<p>“I mean the valley just beyond. See! Look
close.”</p>

<p>He managed the controls so that the great flying
boat headed in between the tall pinnacles of
ice. As they rushed into the narrow valley between
the greenish-white walls of ice, they found
the cleft much deeper than they had at first supposed.
There was an unexpected draught through
the passage, too.</p>

<p>The <em>Winged Arrow</em> swerved unexpectedly to
one side, and her right wing scraped along the
ice cliff. The plane was jarred from stem to stern
and several cables snapped.</p>

<p>The collision dislodged a huge mass of the ice
that came tumbling down, barely missing the tail
of the boat and falling with a thunderous crash
into the bottom of the gorge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>“You’d better get out of this, Tom!” yelled
Ned. “Shoot her up!”</p>

<p>The passage between the ice cliffs was too narrow
and crooked, however, for Tom to risk any
abrupt ascent. Still rocking from the force of
that slam against the ice, the seaplane staggered
on, but at reduced speed. The valley was several
miles long.</p>

<p>Again and yet again the end of one wing or the
other touched the ice. These slight collisions did
no particular harm, but they emphasized the fact
that Tom could not govern the mechanism as perfectly
as he had before.</p>

<p>The balance of the plane was overset. She was
likewise sinking. When Tom signaled for a
“lift,” Brannigan could not work his levers properly.
Like a huge wounded air fowl, the <em>Winged
Arrow</em> fluttered lower and lower.</p>

<p>“My goodness, Tom! are we done for?” gasped
his chum.</p>

<p>Tom’s face was pale, but he did not lose his
self-control. He dared not raise the nose of the
flying boat sharply, for if he did and she then
took a tail spin she would land upon her propeller
and put that out of commission.</p>

<p>The craft continued to descend. Tom waved
a disengaged hand toward the right hand window.
Ned and the others saw what he wished to call
their attention to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>The airtight pontoon at that end of the great
wing had been smashed in the collision with the
wall of ice and now hung partly disengaged from
its proper fastenings. This had so disarranged
the balance of the boat that her management was
most difficult, especially in this narrow chasm.</p>

<p>Another sharp turn in the valley of ice loomed
before them. Below, Tom saw that the bottom
of the gorge was comparatively smooth for some
distance. If they could make a fair landing, they
might be able to repair the pontoon and then rise
on even keel again.</p>

<p>He quickly signaled Brannigan, who shut down
the motors. The roar of them ceased almost at
once. The great flying boat sank to rest in the
heart of the giant iceberg.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br>
<span class="fs80">IMPRISONED IN THE ICE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When the throbbing of the motors ceased and
the flying boat had stopped rebounding on its
wheels and tail, the party in the pilot room stared
at each other in a silence that was pregnant with
anxiety. Even Koku, who stood on guard, felt
that the situation of the <em>Winged Arrow</em> was serious;
yet Koku believed that the “magic” of his
Master Tom was equal to almost any emergency.</p>

<p>Tom as a usual thing had plenty of confidence
in himself, and especially in his ability to get out
of scrapes. But this was one event over which
he seemed to have little control.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Got to find that out, I guess,” admitted the
young inventor. “First of all the boys will have
to fix that pontoon. It’s a mess. And without
it in position the flying boat will be lopsided when
I try to raise her.”</p>

<p>“Great!” groaned Ned. “So we are marooned
down here at the bottom of this hole in the ice?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>Tom went aft to confer with his mechanicians.
Ned and Kingston got into their outer furs, lent
an extra coat to Captain Karofsen, and the trio
opened the door and by the aid of a light steel
ladder got down upon the ice.</p>

<p>The gorge was not more than four hundred feet
wide at this point, and the walls of ice towered
above their heads at least a thousand feet. If
they found it necessary to scale those heights
afoot, it would be a difficult and perilous venture.</p>

<p>Tom and the mechanicians came piling out after
a bit, and a close inspection was made of the airtight
boat pendant from the right wing. It could
be repaired, of course; but it necessarily would
take considerable time.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Tom. “We have food and
heat in plenty. Do your best, Brannigan. Meanwhile
the rest of us will take a look through this
cañon. I wonder if firing our rifles would attract
the attention of Mr. Nestor and the others if they
are near here.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what it might do,” said the wireless
operator, Kingston.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“It might bring down an avalanche of ice on
our heads. You know a cracking stick has been
known to start an avalanche.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Ned. “I wish you didn’t
know so much. Why tell us that? I’ll get a crick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
in my neck now, I know, watching out for the
ice to fall.”</p>

<p>But it was no joking matter. Kingston was
right, as Tom well knew. Yet the young inventor
felt that they should try as quickly as possible to
find Mr. Damon and Mary’s father. If the two
were still on the giant iceberg it would be well if
they were discovered soon. Tom had no desire
to remain marooned at the bottom of this gorge
for long.</p>

<p>Captain Karofsen was still cheerfully optimistic
about finding his seamen and passengers from the
wrecked <em>Kalrye</em>. There were thousands of places
in the iceberg where they might conceal themselves.
And unless by chance they had seen the
seaplane flying over the berg, the castaways would
never know that a searching party had come to
look for them.</p>

<p>The schooner captain, however, agreed that it
would be unsafe to fire the guns. At least, it
must not be done down here in the maw of the
iceberg.</p>

<p>“We bane look for them—yes? If they haf
been here they must leave somet’ing behind. We
see where they camp—yes?”</p>

<p>“Come on!” Tom sang out. “We would better
keep together. No knowing what there may
be on this berg besides castaways.”</p>

<p>“Bears, for instance!” rejoined Ned Newton.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
“Come on, Koku. Maybe that big spear of yours
may be of some use yet.”</p>

<p>The giant grinned and marched ahead with the
spear poised for quick use. The party took up
their march along the bottom of the gorge, leaving
Brannigan and his helpers to repair the flying
boat.</p>

<p>From above, as the flying boat had hovered
over the ice peaks, the party had gained rather an
unsatisfactory idea of what the gorge was like.
But, of course, had it not been for the accident
to the pontoon Tom would never have descended
into the cañon between these towering, icy walls
with his invention.</p>

<p>Beyond the place where the <em>Winged Arrow</em> had
been forced to land there seemed to be several
miles of the gorge, and it was by no means a
straightaway cleft in the ice. It twisted and
turned like the path of a tortured snake.</p>

<p>“We’d have a fat chance following this cañon
in that flying boat,” remarked Ned. “Quick as
they got one thing repaired, we’d crash into a
spur of this ice and crack something else. I tell
you, Tom, just as soon as we can, we want to
get up out of this hole.”</p>

<p>“Reckon you are right,” agreed his chum.
“Hi! See there! What is it that Koku has
found?”</p>

<p>The giant had suddenly increased his stride,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
thrusting his spear forward and showing every
evidence of excitement. He was several rods in
advance of the remainder of the party. Tom and
the others half expected to see somebody rise
up to face the giant, but as they rounded a spur
of ice and joined Koku there seemed to be nobody
else in sight.</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p>“Master see?” exclaimed the giant, and showed
them what he had speared.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! A bean can!” cried Tom.</p>

<p>Ned burst into laughter. “Civilization—a sure
mark!” he chortled. “Yankees have been here,
you may be sure.”</p>

<p>Tom turned to Captain Karofsen.</p>

<p>“How about it, Captain? There is the label
still sticking to it. Was that a brand of beans included
in the stores of the <em>Kalrye</em>?”</p>

<p>“That iss idt,” rejoined the schooner captain.
“They been here—yes. See that cave yonder,
Misder Swift? Perhaps they have been there in
that cavern.”</p>

<p>Koku had already seen the opening of a considerable
cavity in one wall of the gorge. He
advanced cautiously. The cavern appeared to be
very deep. It was dark beyond the entrance. As
the party hesitated before the opening they could
distinctly feel a draught of air blowing from the
hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a tunnel, I bet,” said Ned. “What say?
Think it goes clear through this ice mountain to
the plain beyond?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Tom. “These ice
cliffs seem honeycombed with such caves.”</p>

<p>Koku suddenly shouted and darted forward
into the mouth of the cave. There was a savage
roar in reply—but it was no human voice that
answered the giant’s challenge.</p>

<p>“A bear!” exclaimed Tom, and he was first
to follow the excited Koku into the half darkened
cavity.</p>

<p>Ned was close on the young inventor’s heels.</p>

<p>“Tom, do have a care!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“No time for care!” panted Tom. “Koku’s
fearless! No telling what he’ll do!”</p>

<p>The giant thrust mightily with his spear and
the challenging roar of the bear changed instantly
to a scream of pain. With a crash of ice and
breaking spear-handle, the huge beast appeared
in the entrance to the cave.</p>

<p>Koku was overturned. He fell sprawling, with
the broken handle still clutched in his mighty
grip. The bear reared, plucking at the staff that
impaled it. It stood taller than Captain Karofsen,
or even Koku. It was a drab-white polar bear
of fierce aspect, and its rumbling growls reverberated
from the walls of ice, making a deafening
clamor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>The schooner captain started forward, rifle
raised, and in a moment flame darted from the
muzzle of his weapon. The bear was hit—indeed,
the captain could not have missed it—but it was
not yet dead and fell back into the darkness of
the cave.</p>

<p>They all advanced, holding their guns ready
for another attack. Even Koku scrambled up
and came on, brandishing his broken staff. It
was fortunate indeed that the three young fellows
and their two gigantic companions followed
the wounded bear so closely.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the echoing explosion of Captain
Karofsen’s rifle died away when a mightier report
sounded over their heads. Everybody
halted, appalled. The peril of the wounded bear
was forgotten. White-faced and motionless,
they stared at one another. They all knew
that something of vastly greater menace had occurred.</p>

<p>The explosion above was the breaking away
of some overhanging shelf of ice. It came sliding
and bursting down the face of the cliff and
in half a minute was dumped with a terrific shock
directly in the mouth of this cave which they had
entered.</p>

<p>Powdered ice almost smothered the party for
a few moments. Such light as there had been
outside the cave in the cañon was snuffed out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
The avalanche crowded the cave’s entrance and
made the five explorers prisoners with a suddenness
that stunned them all.</p>

<p>While from ahead, in the pitch darkness, came
again the challenge of the wounded bear. It was
by no means <em>hors-de-combat</em>. The wounded
brute was full of fight. And to fire again in hope
of killing the bear might bring the very roof of
the ice cave down upon their heads!</p>

</div>

<p>The intense darkness inside the cave made the
event a serious one. The wounded polar bear
might charge among them at any moment, and
as they were all dressed in furs it would be difficult
to distinguish each other from the bear.</p>

<p>The bear uttered another terrific roar and
charged from the back of the cave. Koku’s war
cry was almost as savage, and, knocking the
others right and left, he sprang between his beloved
master and the wild beast.</p>

<p>Tom, however, did not lose his self-possession.
He was a little slow in getting it out, but he produced
in time a flashlight, and the ray of it revealed
the glaring eyes, the open, dripping jaws,
and the blood-bedabbled breast of the big polar
bear.</p>

<p>The blinding ray of electric light confused the
animal and Koku reached him with several terrific
whacks with the staff of his spear.</p>

<p>With one side swipe of its right paw the growling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
beast tossed the weapon away and drove
Koku to his knees. It reached with its left paw
to seize the giant, and the curved claws all but
caught him.</p>

<p>“Look out!” shrieked Ned. “He’ll have you,
sure!”</p>

<p>Koku leaped up, but scarcely escaped the return
swing of the bear’s paw. Even the wind
of it was enough to send the man to the ice again.
With a blood-curdling roar the polar bear flung
himself forward on all four paws, and his shaggy
breast covered Koku.</p>

<p>It looked as though the faithful servant was
done for! His spear stuck a hand’s breadth out
of the bear behind its shoulder. The blood
poured from that and from the gunshot wound
like muddy red bilge being pumped from a ship’s
hold.</p>

<p>At this dreadful instant Olaf Karofsen flung
away his rifle, drew a great knife from his belt,
and leaped for the savagely wagging head of the
bear. It seemed as though he gave himself over
utterly to the jaws of the beast. The creature’s
teeth snapped with a clash of ivory that sounded
well nigh as loud as had the rifle shot.</p>

<p>But the gigantic Icelander escaped the jaws.
He made a mighty downward thrust with the
skinning knife.</p>

<p>The point of it entered the bear’s spine right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
behind the skull and must have severed the first
vertebra. The beast groaned with pain, weaving
to and fro on its feet. For the moment all the
fight was taken out of the animal. It shuddered
and began to sink to the ice.</p>

<p>Uttering a great shout, Tom darted forward
and seized Koku’s shoulders. With Captain
Karofsen’s help he dragged Koku from under the
dying bear. The huge body of the brute sunk
slowly upon the very spot where Koku had lain.
The giant could not have lived under the dead
weight of the mountain of flesh.</p>

<p>Ned had picked up Tom’s torch and now illumined
the scene. The two giants were grinning
at each other broadly. Tom spoke rather brokenly.</p>

<p>“I declare, boys, that was some fight! I’m
proud of you, Koku. And how can I ever thank
you, Captain Karofsen?”</p>

<p>The schooner captain was all seriousness again
in a moment. He said to Tom:</p>

<p>“We nefer mind dot. The bear, he iss dead.
But das snow and ice block us in here. We nefer
dig out. We haf no tools.”</p>

<p>Ned had turned the ray of the light upon the
mass of broken ice that completely filled the
mouth of the cavity into which they had ventured.
From the sound of the avalanche when
it fell, there could be little doubt but that the mass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
was rods thick. And the distance and force with
which it had fallen had packed the shattered ice
so tightly that there could be no hope of finding
a passage through it.</p>

<p>“But, say!” exclaimed Kingston, when this fact
had been discussed, “don’t you fellows remember
that there was a current of air blowing out
of this cave when we stood before it? You mentioned
that fact, Newton.”</p>

<p>“I noticed it myself,” Tom agreed quickly.</p>

<p>“So did I,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“We haf no feel of de wind now,” observed
Captain Karofsen.</p>

<p>“Me look,” cried Koku, who understood fully
the situation and its attendant dangers. “If there
be hole, I come back and tell Master.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Koku!” exclaimed Tom Swift. “I
know you can pretty well see like a cat in the
dark. But I think we had better stick together.
We will all go with you on this search for another
opening to the cave.”</p>

<p>“Undt leaf das bear? Not even skin him? It
is meat. We may need it,” said the schooner
captain, in some doubt.</p>

<p>“We have provisions for a week aboard the
<em>Winged Arrow</em>,” Tom said lightly.</p>

<p>“And one sure thing,” supplemented Ned.
“Nobody will get this bear if we leave it where
it lies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“But if we do not skin him while das body he
iss warm, we haf a pad time doing so,” declared
the Icelander.</p>

<p>“I do not think we should bother with the
bear,” Tom said slowly. “I am worried about
getting back to the seaplane. We may get through
this cave and find ourselves far up in these mountains
of ice. We will have difficulty in lowering
ourselves down into that gorge where the
plane is. Don’t bother with this bear. Let us
go on.”</p>

<p>“By jinks!” exclaimed Ned. “They say every
cloud has a silver lining. It is so blamed dark
right now that I cannot see any silver behind this
cloud.”</p>

<p>“Cheer up!” cried Tom, his own voice changing
with an effort. “Lead ahead, Koku. Give
me that torch, Ned. Look out where you step.
There may be fissures here, or sink-holes, to fall
into. Have a care, Koku.”</p>

<p>“Me have much care, Master,” said the faithful
giant. “I feel wind again.” He held up a
finger he had wetted. “Yes. Wind come through
big ice cave. We find um place to go out. Wait
and see.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” muttered Ned, as he came along
in the rear of the small procession.</p>

<p>Farther back in the chamber in the ice was
the entrance to a tunnel more than man-high. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
was of considerable width, too, and when the
party had entered it, almost at once the explorers
found that the pitch of the floor was sharply
upwards.</p>

<p>The tunnel was by no means straight, twisting
around and around, and in places it proved to be
open to the sky. There were deep clefts in the
ice mountain that exposed the passage to the light
of day.</p>

<p>Some of these cuts were deep with snow, for
there had already been snow flurries in the Arctic
Ocean from which this giant iceberg had
drifted.</p>

<p>The explorers became quite hopeful as they
pressed on, for it seemed as though finally there
must be an exit to the tunnel. They spoke cheerfully
together, but were somewhat worried over
the fact that Brannigan and his mates would be
disturbed by their delayed return.</p>

<p>“They won’t know what to make of the delay,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>“But if they heard the avalanche—and of
course they did—they may suspect what has happened
to us,” Tom remarked. “Hullo! What is
it, Koku?”</p>

<p>The giant had halted and put out a restraining
hand to stop those behind him. Tom shot
the bright ray of the lamp ahead. He saw nothing,
for there was a sharp turn in the passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
there. They stood silent, waiting. The giant
crept forward.</p>

<p>When the man-mountain reached the turn in
the wall of ice, he stretched his neck around it.
He stood so for so long that Tom went forward,
too, making no noise. Almost at once, when he
reached Koku’s station, Tom heard a slight noise
farther along the tunnel.</p>

<p>“Listen!” he whispered, and held up his hand
for silence.</p>

<p>Was it an animal? Perhaps another bear?
The young fellow unslung his rifle, for dangerous
as it was to fire a weapon amid the towering ice,
such another savage beast as that which had previously
attacked them could only be met with
powder and ball.</p>

<p>Koku flashed his master a quick glance. His
wide mouth split his face in a grin. Something
amused Koku immensely, but what it was Tom
did not at first understand.</p>

<p>The others ventured forward until all stood in
a group at the turn of the tunnel. Tom was listening
again. The noise was repeated. Suddenly
he swung about and slapped his chum on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Ned,” he whispered hoarsely, “you were saying
there was no silver lining to this cloud of
trouble! Don’t you believe it! This is its silver
lining. Listen!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>As he ceased speaking a hollow voice echoed
along the passage:</p>

<p>“Bless the icicles on my mustache, this is the
coldest house I ever lived in! The landlord should
be prosecuted,” and then the deep, bass laugh of
Wakefield Damon reverberated in the ice-cleft.</p>

<p>“What do you know about this!”</p>

<p>“Here in the ice cave!”</p>

<p>“Come on and surprise them!”</p>

<p>At these words all rushed forward.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br>
<span class="fs80">BACK TO THE FLYING BOAT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The excitement of the bear fight and of being
shut into the tunnel through the ice had for the
moment driven out of the minds of all the party
from the flying boat remembrance of the cause
which had brought them here to the giant iceberg.
For the time being even Tom had forgotten
Mr. Damon and Mr. Nestor and their companions.</p>

<p>At least some of the castaways from the
schooner <em>Kalrye</em> were right ahead of Tom’s party.
The booming voice of the excitable Wakefield
Damon and his “blessing” could never be mistaken
by anybody who knew him at all!</p>

<p>Captain Olaf Karofsen burst into a great roar
of laughter, and, cheering loudly, he strode ahead
along the passage.</p>

<p>“We bane findt dem fellers!” he bawled. “Misder
Damon! How you vas now—yes?”</p>

<p>The others heard Mr. Damon cry:</p>

<p>“Here’s that Skowegian, Nestor! Captain of
the <em>Kalrye</em>. What do you know about this?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
Bless my divining rod! I never expected to see
him again.”</p>

<p>The whole party, including Tom, followed the
big captain. They rushed into a circular chamber
in the ice. In the middle was a small fire burning
on a piece of copper sheathing, set up on empty
bean cans to keep the heat from the floor of the
chamber.</p>

<p>There were only two persons present, both
wrapped well in furs. They had been eating
some cooked fish of some kind and drinking tea
from tin pannikins. The man who had first got
up to greet the newcomers was Mr. Wakefield
Damon.</p>

<p>“Bless my horn spectacles!” he gasped, staring.
“Is that Tom Swift I see? And Koku? And
Ned Newton? Bless my imagination! I certainly
must be seeing things.”</p>

<p>“You surely are, Mr. Damon!” cried Ned.
“You are seeing a bunch of castaways—just as
much cast away as you are.”</p>

<p>But Tom gave his closest attention to the other
man—the man who still sat before the fire. There
was no mistaking him, yet he looked so different
from the wan and almost helpless man who had
left Shopton for the Arctic weeks before that the
young inventor could scarcely believe he was
Mary Nestor’s father.</p>

<p>“Mr. Nestor!” gasped Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“Tom, my boy! Did you really come to find
us? My brave fellow!”</p>

<p>“I did not come expecting to find such a picture
of health, Mr. Nestor,” declared Tom, clasping
hands with the ex-invalid. “That crazy Raddiker
wasn’t so crazy as I feared, was he? Why,
Mr. Nestor, you are a picture!”</p>

<p>“I am a picture of a homesick man, believe
me,” declared Mary’s father earnestly. “I don’t
know how you got here, Tom; but I hope you
can take us back home in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Bless my seven-leagued boots! how you must
have traveled to get here so quickly, Tom Swift,”
Mr. Damon suddenly shouted. “How did you
do it? I see the skipper must have got word of
the wreck to you. But how did you fellows get
here?”</p>

<p>“Through the air,” said Ned, laughing.</p>

<p>“The new flying boat?” demanded Mr. Nestor.
“Is it a success, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Bless my flying carpet of Bagdad!” chuckled
Mr. Damon. “Never thought of that! Where
is she? Can you take us all back?”</p>

<p>“We hope to. Though it may be close crowding
with the five sailors. By the way,” added
Tom, “where are they?”</p>

<p>Instantly Mr. Wakefield Damon was very
grave. Mr. Nestor said slowly:</p>

<p>“We had a terrible accident the third day we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
were on this ice island. We were climbing over
the heights, making for a place where we thought
of setting up an oar with a flag, although it
scarcely seemed possible that there would be any
passing ship so late in the fall.</p>

<p>“However,” he went on, “we came to a crevasse
in the ice, and in trying to cross it two of the
men fell and disappeared. We could not reach
them.”</p>

<p>“And bless my disappearing riches!” burst out
Wakefield Damon, “the chest with my legacy from
Aman Dele fell with them. We lost the men and
the thirty thousand dollars in a moment.”</p>

<p>“That is very unfortunate, Mr. Damon,” said
Tom seriously. “Where are the other three sailors
who made up your party?”</p>

<p>“They are out somewhere now hunting for
food—seals or fish, or the like. Brave fellows!
Bless their hats and shoestrings! I mean that all
of them shall be well paid for their faithfulness
to us.”</p>

<p>Captain Karofsen was silent. He had learned
by a single question that the two sailors who had
fallen into the chasm with the treasure chest were
his own brother and his nephew! These relatives
had aroused in the schooner captain a great desire
to recover the castaways.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of here and find your other three
helpers,” Tom said finally. “We must get back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
to the gorge in which we left the flying boat.
Brannigan will believe we are completely lost.”</p>

<p>“And maybe we are,” said Ned, again pessimistic.
“No knowing whether we can get down
into that valley again. And, once there, shall we
be able to lift the <em>Winged Arrow</em> into the air?”</p>

<p>None of the others paid much attention to
Ned’s gloomy words. Mr. Damon and Mr. Nestor
were too much interested in hearing news
from home and Tom’s brief account of the flight
of the flying boat from America to Iceland and
thence to this part of the Arctic Ocean to listen
to Ned.</p>

<p>“It is wonderful!” declared Mr. Nestor. “One
could scarcely believe that you would have so easily
found this particular iceberg—and us upon it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks to the bear,” said Tom. “And if we
get short of provisions we can go back and get
a few bear steaks. Where is the entrance to this
house?”</p>

<p>Mr. Nestor and Mr. Damon led the way. In
two minutes they were out on the open ice, on
the side of one of the ice hills over which the
explorers had previously flown in the flying boat.</p>

<p>“How far are we from the place where we left
the <em>Winged Arrow</em>, Captain?” asked Tom of Olaf
Karofsen.</p>

<p>“It iss so far as that peak—yes? Maype ten
mile. But my odder t’ree men——?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>Almost immediately the party sighted the trio
of sailors coming up the slope from the ice field.
Two of them bore a frozen seal between them.
The other carried the guns and a rope. When
they saw Captain Karofsen and the others they
shrieked their joy and, dropping the seal, scrambled
up the ice slope as fast as possible.</p>

<p>In their own language they broke into a concerted
account of their adventures since the <em>Kalrye</em>
had been wrecked. It was easy for the Americans
to know when the sailors spoke of the loss
of Captain Karofsen’s brother and nephew. The
schooner captain grew very, very grave.</p>

<p>“I wish we might search that chasm you speak
of for those men,” Tom whispered to Mr. Damon.
“You say they carried a bag of provisions, too?”</p>

<p>“Bless my emergency ration, Tom Swift!”
whispered the eccentric gentleman. “We yelled
there and waited around for an hour. There was
not a sound rose from that hole. They must have
been instantly killed.”</p>

<p>“But the money?”</p>

<p>“We-ell,” said Mr. Damon doubtfully. “Of
course, all I thought of at first was the chance
of our getting away from here. But now it looks
different. It might be well to make a search for
the treasure box. But first, let us see,” he added
more vigorously, “if we can get your flying boat
out of that hole you say she is in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>That actually was the main thing to worry
about. And even when the party had reached
the brink of the gorge and fortunately found a
traversable path to the bottom of it and came in
sight of the flying boat, the question as to whether
or no they could get the <em>Winged Arrow</em> into the
air again was the all-important subject of their
thoughts.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br>
<span class="fs80">STILL CRIPPLED</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Brannigan and his associates had become extremely
anxious because of the absence of the captain
of the flying boat and his friends. And when
they reappeared at the bottom of the gorge with
five of the lost men of whom they had been in
search, the mechanicians were inclined to think it
almost a miraculous happening.</p>

<p>It was, however, rather a serious occasion.
The fact that two of the castaways, as well as
thirty thousand dollars in treasure, were utterly
lost cast a cloud over all their minds.</p>

<p>Besides, although the mechanicians had repaired
the airtight pontoon and rigged it to the
end of the seaplane wing again, there was a question
in all their minds as to whether the big flying
boat could be raised from the bottom of the
ice gorge without bringing her into collision again
with the walls.</p>

<p>The five new passengers crowded the carrying
quarters of the seaplane, too. She had not been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
built with the idea of carrying more than twelve
people, and now there were sixteen. Tom believed
that under a fair test the <em>Winged Arrow</em>
would sail with several tons more weight than
she had ever yet carried. But this jump-off was
going to be no fair test.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to take a chance,” said the young
inventor.</p>

<p>“If only we are successful!” murmured Ned.</p>

<p>When they were all inside and the doors were
closed, the young inventor went over the machinery
with great care, personally trying out
each part. He dared not empty the compressed
air tanks, although he would have liked to do
that until the plane had risen above the walls of
the gorge. The air was needed for balance, however;
he was confident of that.</p>

<p>There was not room to turn the plane around
as she rested on her wheels and tail, the ice cliffs
were too near together; while ahead of her was
a very short straight run for her to gain the speed
to fly.</p>

<p>It was a ticklish undertaking. If, under the
thrust of her powerful motors, she went head on
into one wall or the other of the cañon, Tom was
pretty sure that the <em>Winged Arrow</em> would never
get out of the heart of this giant iceberg.</p>

<p>“If we leave both the plane and Mr. Damon’s
treasure here in the ice, we shall certainly have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
to mark this venture down as a total loss,” murmured
Tom, to his chum.</p>

<p>“Huh! we won’t mark anything down,” replied
Ned. “We will have a hot time ever getting to
land. Don’t forget that.”</p>

<p>“I am not likely to overlook it,” confessed the
young inventor. “I never had one of my inventions
put to so severe a test before. And our
lives, you must remember, depend upon the
thing working right.”</p>

<p>“Go on. Do your worst,” urged Ned. “If I
am to spend the rest of my natural life on this
chunk of ice, I want to know it as soon as possible.
Let’s get it over.”</p>

<p>Tom would not do a thing in haste, however.
Not until he had made sure that the mechanism
would work perfectly did he signal Brannigan
to start his motors. He stood at the controls
until the motors were roaring well before he
started the propellers.</p>

<p>The huge boat began to move slowly. Almost
at once she lifted under the pressure of the propellers.
Her nose came up like the head of a
spirited horse. Mr. Wakefield Damon gave voice
to one of his excited explosions:</p>

<p>“Bless all my kites and balloons, she’s going
up!”</p>

<p>“That’s what we want!” exclaimed Ned.
“The higher, the better!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>She was going up! Better than she had ever
taken the air before. Everybody in the pilot room
broke into a cheer, and Tom Swift was as proud
as ever he had felt before in his life over anything
he had built.</p>

<p>Put to the severest sort of test, the <em>Winged
Arrow</em> was making good. How proud his father
would be when he told him of this jump-off from
the bottom of the cleft in the huge iceberg! And
Mary! Aside from the exploration party finding
and rescuing her father, Tom knew that Mary
Nestor would comprehend the feelings of the inventor
of the flying boat which had made this
success possible.</p>

<p>On a short slant skyward, the plane rose higher
and higher. The long Arctic day was just ended,
the sun had dropped below the horizon’s edge,
and a number of pale stars were showing in the
vault above.</p>

<p>The flying boat scaled the heights of the ice
cliffs and finally poised over the deep cleft in
which they had spent so many uncertain hours.
Tom believed that his task here was done. He
meant to fly now to Iceland, as he had promised
Captain Karofsen, and leave the schooner captain
and his men at some handy port.</p>

<p>The young inventor had no intention of being
entangled in any plot engendered by the Russian
Government or its agents. Let all that be explained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
from America. He was sure that Monsieur
Polansky had never obtained his credentials
from the Navy Department by fair means and
that there would be no real trouble awaiting him
when he got back to Shopton.</p>

<p>He smiled upon Ned, who stood beside him,
and began to wheel the flying boat till her nose
pointed to the east. Somewhere in that direction—so
far away that he could not see it—lay
Iceland.</p>

<p>“What is that?” demanded Mr. Wakefield
Damon suddenly. “Look at that smoke. Why,
you’d think that ice mountain was a crater of a
volcano! Bless my smokepipes! it is the equal
of old Mount Hekla.”</p>

<p>The phenomenon to which Mr. Damon pointed
startled them all. A spiral of smoke seemed to
be rising, as he said, out of the higher pinnacle
of ice. The <em>Winged Arrow</em> was circling that
peak. How was it possible for smoke to come
out of a hole in the ice when, as far as they knew,
there was no living human being on the berg
they were leaving?</p>

<p>“Let’s get around to the other side,” cried Ned.
“Goodness me! maybe there are other folks cast
away here.”</p>

<p>“It nefer is <em>dem</em>?” questioned Captain Olaf
Karofsen excitedly.</p>

<p>Tom changed the controls. The great flying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
boat heeled over a little as her nose drove into
the wind. As she passed out from the shelter
of the pinnacle of ice the power of the gale smote
upon the seaplane as it had not before. The
wind howled and whistled.</p>

<p>Tom signaled to the power room for the compressed
air pump to be started again. In this gale
he realized the boat would roll, and this was dangerous.
She needed more balance-weight.</p>

<p>Again the structure rolled and groaned. Mr.
Damon and Mr. Nestor cried out. They had not
experienced this motion before. The <em>Winged
Arrow</em> came to an even keel, then once more
dipped sideways.</p>

<p>With a crash one wing-end scraped along the
hill of ice. The rebound carried the plane away
from the wall of ice; but she began to descend,
slowly but surely.</p>

<p>Tom speeded up, and the groaning boat shot
away from the hillside. Behind them the spiral
of smoke came from a cleft into which it had
been impossible for any of them to see. The flying
boat was flapping downward like a broken-winged
bird!</p>

<p>“Are we wrecked? Is it a smash-up?” queried
Mr. Nestor anxiously.</p>

<p>“Bless my anchors!” gasped Mr. Damon.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to make a landing,” said Tom,
with some show of cheerfulness. “But there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
a pretty level field of ice to make it on. I think
we shall be all right.”</p>

<p>The next moment the boat was bouncing on
its wheels and tail. The power had been shut off.
Soon they came to a halt and it was possible to
discover how badly the flying boat was damaged,
if damaged at all.</p>

<span class="fs80">UNEXPECTED GOOD FORTUNE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. Wakefield Damon was possessed of a
bulldog trait. When he once set his teeth into
a thing he would not let go until he had mastered
it.</p>

<p>While Tom and the others were giving way
to excitement over the result to the flying boat
of the shock it had undergone, Mr. Damon (when
once the door in the hull was opened) leaped out
and stared up the slope of the ice peak to see if
he could again observe the curl of smoke which
had been rising from that height as the flying
boat passed over it.</p>

<p>“There is somebody up there. Bless my tortoise-shell
glasses! there must be somebody up
there. Smoke doesn’t come out of a hill of ice
by any natural means, that is sure.”</p>

<p>But he did not see the smoke now. He called
to Olaf Karofsen. He had picked up a few
words of the Old Norse dialect much used by the
people of the “back end” of Iceland, and the
schooner captain spoke that language, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>So the other Americans in the party did not
understand what Mr. Damon and the captain
were so excitedly talking about.</p>

<p>“What made that smoke, Captain?” demanded
Mr. Damon.</p>

<p>“Fire,” declared the man promptly.</p>

<p>“And fire in an iceberg is not a common thing.
Over there is the crevasse where we lost your
poor brother and his boy. Bless my icepick! but
there is something strange about this.”</p>

<p>“We will go see,” declared the captain.</p>

<p>He hurried for a coil of rope and a rifle. Unnoticed
by the others, the giant seaman and his
employer climbed the slope of the ice mountain.
Tom and his helpers were overhauling the airtight
pontoon that swung from the left wing of
the flying boat. This was the part injured by the
latest collision.</p>

<p>“It must be that I am not so well able to judge
distances as I was,” the young inventor grumbled.
“To smash a wing twice, hand running,
as you might say!”</p>

<p>“It was a puff of wind did this for you,” declared
Ned. “I would not blame my eyesight.”</p>

<p>To work in the open on the ice with a living
gale blowing down from the Pole was by no means
a comfortable situation. The mechanicians had
to take turns in working on the broken wing and
pontoon. A man might easily freeze his hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
while working without gloves. Two gasoline
stoves were brought out of the flying boat and
set up on the ice right where the repair gang
worked. The cook served hot coffee by the gallon.
The passengers did all they could to help,
but that was little.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Nestor noticed the absence of
Mr. Damon and the schooner captain. He asked:</p>

<p>“Have they gone hunting? Why did they
climb that hill, do you suppose, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t we see some smoke up there?” queried
Tom, only mildly interested. “Why, yes! Mr.
Damon was talking about smoke from the ice
peak, and that got me interested—interested
enough to scale the old plane across the shoulder
of that hill,” and the young inventor laughed
rather ruefully.</p>

<p>“There’s something going on up there, Mr.
Swift!” exclaimed Kingston suddenly. “See
there?”</p>

<p>He pointed up the heights. Several hundred
feet above the plain the big seaman was standing
and waving his arms wildly to attract attention.
Now his voice came booming down from the
eminence:</p>

<p>“Mis-der Swift! Mis-der Swift!” he singsonged.
“Send up a couple of my bullies undt
a pread pag. Hurry oop!”</p>

<p>“Wonder what’s going on up there,” remarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
Ned, as Tom waved to a couple of the seamen
to obey their skipper’s demand.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a look ourselves,” Kingston said,
and started up the ascent.</p>

<p>Tom could not go; but there was nothing to
keep Ned back, so he fell in behind the wireless
operator. Besides, one could keep warm on the
ice only while in motion. The two young fellows
swarmed up the hill as fast as they could
travel, while the sailors came on in their rear with
the bag.</p>

<p>Ned and his companion found Captain Karofsen
on a little shelf of the hill. He was much excited
and his face was again a smile.</p>

<p>“It is wonderful! Wonderful!” he declared.
“Come with me, young gentlemen. It is wonderful.”</p>

<p>“I bet it is,” commented Ned. “But just what
is it?”</p>

<p>They fell in behind the excited captain of the
<em>Kalrye</em>, who led them along the shelf, around an
abrupt corner, and brought them out upon a small
plateau in which there was a sink. Mr. Damon
was lying flat upon his stomach and looking down
into this chasm. He turned his red face toward
Ned and Kingston and burst out with:</p>

<p>“Bless my Italian gardens! here is the most
wonderful thing I ever saw. Did you bring that
rope?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“It’s coming,” said Ned. “What is the matter
down there, Mr. Damon?”</p>

<p>“Greatest thing in the world, Ned!” exclaimed
the eccentric gentleman. “The coincidence is
wonderful. Who would ever have thought it!
Well!”</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful, all right,” repeated the puzzled
Ned. “Both you and Captain Karofsen say so.
But just what <em>is</em> it?”</p>

<p>“Come here! See yonder? Half a mile or so
away is the crevasse down which those two unfortunate
men tumbled who were carrying my
chest of Danish gold. We never expected to see
them again—or the chest. And I guess the chest
<em>is</em> done for,” admitted the excited Mr. Damon.</p>

<p>Ned and the operator were now beside him.
They knelt on the ice and likewise peered down
into the blue-white depths of the sink. Ned uttered
a shout of amazement.</p>

<p>“What do you know about this!” murmured
Kingston.</p>

<p>Under an out-thrust shelf of ice and on the
bottom of the hole a small fire was smouldering.
Two muffled figures lay beside this tiny fire. But
they moved, first one and then the other raising
his head and then waving a feeble hand to the
spectators on the brink of the ice wall.</p>

<p>“The lost seamen?” demanded New Newton of
Mr. Damon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“Karofsen’s brother and nephew,” the gentleman
answered. “I don’t care about the lost gold!
The men are still alive! They must have suffered
terribly. And how they found fuel for even that
little fire, I don’t see.”</p>

<p>The eager schooner captain just then arrived
with the pair of seamen he had called. They had
a coil of rope long enough to reach to the bottom
of the cleft in the ice.</p>

<p>It was plain that the men below could not help
themselves. Kingston, who was the lightest of
the party, volunteered to go down.</p>

<p>“Take the pag vonce,” said Karofsen eagerly.
“I pet you it vill come handy—yes? Now, are
you ready?”</p>

<p>The operator swung out from the ice, and fending
himself from the wall with feet and hands,
was lowered safely to the floor of the sink. As
soon as he stood upon his feet there he disengaged
himself from the loop of the rope and ran across
to the two men.</p>

<p>They tried to struggle up, but both dropped
back. They were weak from lack of nourishment
and their extremities were undoubtedly
frost-bitten. The older man insisted by gestures
(he could speak but few English words) that
Kingston aid his son, first of all.</p>

<p>The wireless operator seized the boy in his
arms and staggered across the sink with him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
He fastened him safely in the noose and gave
the signal for those above to “hoist away.”</p>

<p>Although the turning body of the youth scraped
several times against the ice, he was not hurt
while his uncle and the sailors drew him up.
Kingston, when he saw him swinging near the
top, ran back to the other man. The latter had
struggled to his knees and seized the bread bag
that Kingston had brought down with him by
Karofsen’s advice.</p>

<p>What he wished to do with the bag puzzled
Kingston for a moment. Then he saw what had
been cached under the overshot ledge of ice, well
back against the wall.</p>

<p>“Right-o, my man!” the operator cried. “I am
wise to it. Here! Let me do all that. We’ll
send the bag up before you go up. I quite understand.”</p>

<p>He was much excited. And the situation was
indeed an exciting one. Kingston knew that the
spectators at the top of the ice cliff were going
to feel much amazement when that bread bag
swung up there at the end of the noose.</p>

<p>The heavy bag swung out of his sight. Then
came a yell. Mr. Damon almost fell over the
brink of the wall.</p>

<p>“Bless my coupon bonds and the interest on
my mortgages, these courageous men have saved
my thirty thousand dollars! It’s gold! They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
broke up the chest to make a fire, but here is the
money intact.</p>

<p>“Here, Olaf! Swing your brother up here in
a hurry. I want to hug him. Bless my last red
cent! if we get off of this giant iceberg alive, he
and his boy shall never know want as long as
they live.</p>

<p>“Lay onto the line, lads! Now, haul! Bless
my hemp and cordage! If that line parts now,
we’ll lose one of the most honest men who ever
walked on two feet. Altogether, now!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br>
<span class="fs80">BACK FROM THE ARCTIC</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The line did not break. The captain’s brother
was drawn to the top of the low cliff. After
that Kingston was raised. The delighted Wakefield
Damon was talking all the time and could
scarcely wait to help bear the two exhausted seamen
down the hill to where the flying boat was
being repaired.</p>

<p>Captain Karofsen carried the bag of gold coin
over his shoulder, while the other five from the
flying boat bore the exhausted sailors down the
slope. When Tom and the others saw them coming
they were likewise excited. The recovery
of these two men completed the rescue of the
party of castaways to search for whom the
<em>Winged Arrow</em> had been brought by her inventor
from the States.</p>

<p>“Nothing to be put down on the debit side of
the column, Tom!” shouted Ned, when he drew
near. “If you can make the old plane ride again,
we can figure that we’ve turned the trick.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Damon’s fortune?” shouted Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“Bless my Russian rubles!” chortled Mr.
Damon, “I could buy up the entire Russian Government
monetary output now. Here is Aman
Dele’s treasure that he willed me. I am a lucky
man. And these brave fellows shall share in my
good luck.”</p>

<p>He was as good as his word. It may as well
be said here that Mr. Damon, with all his eccentricities,
was a very honorable man. He reimbursed
Captain Karofsen for his time and exertions,
gave each of the sailors a handsome present,
and to the captain’s brother and son he made
over a trust fund that, as he had declared, would
keep the two injured men from want for the remainder
of their lives.</p>

<p>For the two who had fallen down the crevasse
with the treasure chest had been exposed so long
to the frost that it would be months before they
would be able to go to sea. All these good offices,
however, Mr. Damon arranged later through a
legal representative.</p>

<p>Just now the entire party was anxious to discover
if the <em>Winged Arrow</em> would fly. Half the
short Arctic night had been expended in these
recent exertions. Brannigan and his men had
taken the tools and the gasoline stoves back into
the ship. They all climbed aboard as soon as
possible and once more preparations were made
for a jump-off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>“If this old plane doesn’t act right now,” said
Tom, “I’ll take her home and break her up for
scrap. That’s a promise.”</p>

<p>“If you get her home at all,” said Ned. “I
hope she won’t get temperamental about the time
we are over the Newfoundland fishing banks, for
instance.”</p>

<p>Their first destination, of course, was Iceland.
The flying boat was overcrowded, and Tom
wished to place Captain Karofsen and his five
men somewhere near their own homes before
launching out for the longer flight for America
across the North Atlantic.</p>

<p>Tom’s first anxiety, however, was to get the
huge flying boat into the air and learn if she
would respond properly to the controls. The motors
raced all right when they were tried, and
he believed that he knew now just how much compressed
air to order pumped into the skin of the
hull.</p>

<p>Yet he signaled Brannigan and stood at the
controls when the time came for the jump-off
with a feeling of anxiety. How would the boat
act? If the whole party were marooned on this
iceberg as Mr. Damon and Mr. Nestor and the
five sailors had been, who would come to their
rescue?</p>

<p>“Not a chance!” Ned answered to these queries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“All ready, Bran?” called Tom into the tube.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, boss!” exclaimed the mechanician.</p>

<p>The hull of the flying boat began to tremble.
The ice field ahead of her was quite clear of rubble
and there were no chasms. The propeller
began to spin and the boat rolled forward.</p>

<p>Trembling, shaking like some huge fowl trying
to take the air, the <em>Winged Arrow</em> started. She
cocked her nose skyward and left the ice. Up,
up she soared, on a long slant into the east. The
motors throbbed rhythmically while the gale
whistled through the stays.</p>

<p>Tom felt the pull of the controls and knew that
the slight rocking of the boat betrayed a good
balance. On a graceful curve she left the surface
of the iceberg and leaped out over the tumbling,
open sea.</p>

<p>There was a wide channel between this huge
berg and the nearest field of ice. Flocks of Arctic
sea birds rose whirring beneath the flying
boat. On the edge of the ice they saw two solemn
looking polar bears fishing for seals. Sea
lions played on one shelving beach of ice.</p>

<p>“Farewell to the giant iceberg!” shouted Ned,
as the <em>Winged Arrow</em> left the mountain of crystal
behind. “I hope I don’t see any ice again
for a year—not even next summer! B-r-r-r!
Shall we ever be really warm again?”</p>

<p>They were packed so close in the cabin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
pilot room of the flying boat that they should
have been more than ordinarily warm. It was
indeed an uncomfortable journey to the nearest
land.</p>

<p>Captain Karofsen had studied the chart and
he marked a little town near Reykjavik where
Tom could make a landing without attracting attention
from the authorities of the island. Of
course it would have been a simple matter to get
by cablegram from the United States information
that would show the Governor of Iceland
that the Russians were trying to steal the flying
boat. But that might delay the party for several
weeks.</p>

<p>And nobody was more eager than Tom to get
back to Shopton. He confided to Captain Karofsen
certain messages to be sent to Mr. Barton
Swift and Mary Nestor, for he expected that the
flying boat would be all of three days on the journey
home, even if she did not have to descend
for repairs.</p>

<p>He made the landing on the spot Captain Karofsen
pointed out, with success. Nothing needed
adjusting, and five minutes after taking the
ground the seamen and their captain were out
of the flying boat. Then, after getting a supply
of gasoline and oil, the latter made another
jump-off.</p>

<p>“The old plane is doing you proud, Tom!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
cried Ned, when they were in the air again. “Just
keep away from icebergs, and I feel sure you will
have no trouble with her. But believe me! if
you take another flight into the Arctic, you can
count me out.”</p>

<p>In several ways the wonderful voyage of the
<em>Winged Arrow</em> had never been equaled by any
flying boat. Her long jump over the Atlantic
proved her to be a unique craft. She could remain
in the air at her pilot’s will. She had proved
that she could rest in rough water. And the
usage she had received on the giant iceberg showed
her to be a craft able to endure a deal of knocking
about.</p>

<p>Naturally, when she returned to Shopton, she
was not the spick and span looking flying boat
that she had been when she left that base for the
Arctic. Nevertheless, her inventor was satisfied
that he knew now just what he could do with
her.</p>

<p>“Will you sell her to the Navy Department if
they want her, Tom?” asked Mr. Nestor, during
the flight home.</p>

<p>“I am going to sell her to nobody. Not even
to the Russian Government,” said Tom, smiling.
“We are in no war now, thank goodness, and I
mean to keep and improve this craft until she
can be no further perfected. Of course,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
added loyally, “she will be at the service of the
country at any time she may be needed.”</p>

<p>“There is a whole lot I can do to her yet to
make her of more value both in war and commerce.
I wish I might make these improvements,
however, without so much publicity. The Swift
Construction Company is getting into the papers
too much.” Then he grinned suddenly. “You
know, after all, what I want is a quiet life.”</p>

<p>Ned, listening to this, made an awful face.</p>

<p>“Whoo!” he shouted. “The sort of quiet life
Tom Swift wants would make a jumping jack
hysterical! Tom, you know you could not keep
quiet and give up adventures if you had five hundred
times the fortune Mr. Damon is bringing
home with him from Iceland.”</p>

<p>“Bless my foreign exchange!” exclaimed Mr.
Damon, “that is a true word you said, Ned Newton.
Why, anybody who has anything to do
with Tom Swift is bound to get into the most
exciting situations——”</p>

<p>“Listen to him!” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“We know who is the person who manages to
get into trouble without any help,” declared Mr.
Nestor laughing. “I certainly am obliged to
Brother Damon for taking me to the Arctic. It
has restored my health. I feel like another man
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>“Nevertheless, if Wakefield Damon asks me to
walk down the street with him to buy a necktie after
this, I shall be afraid to accompany him. Something
unexpected is bound to happen when one
is in that gentleman’s company.”</p>

<p>“Bless my reputation!” groaned the eccentric
gentleman, “have you all such an opinion of me
as this? I declare! I will go home and raise
fancy chickens and nothing shall entice me on
another journey. Humph! That is, until Tom
Swift decides to start off to the antipodes. I
could not contain myself at home if I knew he
was away junketing.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Forewarned of the coming of the flying boat,
half the population of Shopton and all Tom’s
workmen were awaiting its appearance. Tom
brought the <em>Winged Arrow</em> over the field behind
the shops, spiraled down, and took the ground
very lightly. When they opened the door in the
side of the hull the first faces they saw were those
of Mary Nestor and her mother and Mr. Barton
Swift and his faithful attendant, Eradicate
Sampson.</p>

<p>When Rad set his eyes on the gigantic Koku
he cried out:</p>

<p>“Ma goodness, Mars’ Tom! couldn’t you lose
dat big nuisance up da in de Antic Seas somewhar?
He suah ain’t much good ’round yere.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
I reckoned he’d make good polar bear bait, or de
like. Has I got to feed him again?”</p>

<p>Koku showed his teeth in a wide smile. “No
polum bear kill Koku,” he declared, leaping out
of the flying boat and beginning to strut. “Koku
kill bear. Killum with spear. Koku great chief.”</p>

<p>“Koku great nuisance,” grumbled Rad, grabbing
the big fellow by the arm. “Come on wid
me. I got a beefsteak ha’f as big as a bedsheet
to brile for yo’. Yo’ suah isn’t much good, but
we got to feed yo’.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nestor was welcomed by his wife and
daughter almost as though he had risen from the
grave. His improvement in health was so great
that they could not cease exclaiming over it.</p>

<p>Tom and his other friends from the flying boat
were all greeted most hilariously by the crowd.
The mechanicians and Kingston had their stories
to tell. Ned hurried away on business. Mr.
Barton Swift wrung his son’s hand.</p>

<p>“I was afraid for a while that that strange
Russian would manage to make you trouble. Admiral
Gilder found out about him soon after you
had started on your cruise. The fellow had got
credentials from the Navy Board by trickery.”</p>

<p>“If the Soviet Government had had a bunch
of flying men up there at Reykjavik, ready to hop
aboard the craft when they got us out and under
guard,” said Tom, “they might have managed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
to get the <em>Winged Arrow</em> as far as Russia, and
we would have whistled for any money. Their
printing presses could not print rubles fast enough
to pay me for this flying boat.”</p>

<p>“Then you consider her a success, Tom?”
asked Mr. Swift smiling.</p>

<p>“She most certainly is. As far as I have gone
I am satisfied. But I have not finished with her
yet. You wait and see, Dad.”</p>

<p>Then he hurried away to join Mary Nestor.
And, after what Tom had done for the young
girl’s father, the reader may believe that what
Mary Nestor said to Tom made him blush to the
tips of his ears!</p>

<p>A new line of fascinating tales for little girls. Honey
Bunch is a dainty, thoughtful little girl, and to know her
is to take her to your heart at once.</p>

<p class="no-indent">HONEY BUNCH: JUST A LITTLE GIRL</p>

<p>Happy days at home, helping mamma and the washerlady. And Honey
Bunch helped the house painters too—or thought she did.</p>

<p class="no-indent">HONEY BUNCH: HER FIRST VISIT TO THE CITY</p>

<p>What wonderful sights Honey Bunch saw when she went to visit her
cousins in New York! And she got lost in a big hotel and wandered into
a men’s convention!</p>

<p class="no-indent">HONEY BUNCH: HER FIRST DAYS ON THE FARM</p>

<p>Can you remember how the farm looked the first time you visited it?
How big the cows and horses were, and what a roomy place to play in the
barn proved to be?</p>

<p class="no-indent">HONEY BUNCH: HER FIRST VISIT TO THE SEASHORE</p>

<p>Honey Bunch soon got used to the big waves and thought playing in the
sand great fun. And she visited a merry-go-round, and took part in a seaside
pageant.</p>

<p class="no-indent">HONEY BUNCH: HER FIRST LITTLE GARDEN</p>

<p>It was great sport to dig and to plant with one’s own little garden tools.
But best of all was when Honey Bunch won a prize at the flower show.</p>

<p class="no-indent">HONEY BUNCH: HER FIRST DAYS IN CAMP</p>

<p>It was a great adventure for Honey Bunch when she journeyed to Camp
Snapdragon. It was wonderful to watch the men erect the tent, and more
wonderful to live in it and have good times on the shore and in the water.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs120">By ALICE DALE HARDY</p>

<hr class="double">
<p class="center no-indent">
<b>Individual Colored Wrappers. Attractively Illustrated.<br>
Every Volume Complete in Itself.</b><br>
</p>
<hr class="double">


<p>Here is as ingenious a series of books for little folks as
has ever appeared since “Alice in Wonderland.” The idea
of the Riddle books is a little group of children—three girls
and three boys decide to form a riddle club. Each book is
full of the adventures and doings of these six youngsters,
but as an added attraction each book is filled with a lot of
the best riddles you ever heard.</p>


<p class="no-indent">THE RIDDLE CLUB AT HOME</p>

<p>An absorbing tale that all boys and girls will enjoy reading.
How the members of the club fixed up a clubroom in the Larue
barn, and how they, later on, helped solve a most mysterious
happening, and how one of the members won a valuable prize,
is told in a manner to please every young reader.</p>


<p class="no-indent">THE RIDDLE CLUB IN CAMP</p>

<p>The club members went into camp on the edge of a beautiful
lake. Here they had rousing good times swimming, boating
and around the campfire. They fell in with a mysterious old man
known as The Hermit of Triangle Island. Nobody knew his
real name or where he came from until the propounding of a
riddle solved these perplexing questions.</p>


<p class="no-indent">THE RIDDLE CLUB THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS</p>

<p>This volume takes in a great number of winter sports, including
skating and sledding and the building of a huge snowman.
It also gives the particulars of how the club treasurer lost the
dues entrusted to his care and what the melting of the great
snowman revealed.</p>


<p class="no-indent">THE RIDDLE CLUB AT SUNRISE BEACH</p>

<p>This volume tells how the club journeyed to the seashore and
how they not only kept up their riddles but likewise had good
times on the sand and on the water. Once they got lost in a fog
and are marooned on an island. Here they made a discovery
that greatly pleased the folks at home.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
